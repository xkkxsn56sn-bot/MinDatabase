Hildegard von Bingen was born around 1098 in Bermersheim bei Alzey, in the Rheinhessen region of present-day Germany, and died on September 17, 1179 at the monastery of Rupertsberg near Bingen.

## Family Origins and Early Life

Hildegard emerged from the noble ranks of twelfth-century German society, born to Hildebert von Bermersheim, a knight in service to Meginhard, Count of Spanheim, and his wife Mechthild (also called Mechtild of Merxheim-Nahet). As the tenth and youngest child in her family, she was consecrated to God as a tithe according to medieval custom, a practice that dedicated the tenth child to religious service. Her family belonged to the free lower nobility, a social stratum that possessed sufficient wealth and status to provide their children with religious education while maintaining connections to the regional aristocracy. The von Bermersheim lineage held lands in the fertile Rheinhessen region, an area that had experienced significant economic development during the high medieval period. Her father Hildebert's service to Count Meginhard indicates the family's integration into the feudal networks that characterized German noble society of the late eleventh century. The decision to dedicate Hildegard to religious life reflected both pious conviction and practical considerations regarding inheritance and family resources. Her mother Mechthild appears to have been instrumental in arranging Hildegard's early religious education, demonstrating the active role of noble women in their children's spiritual development. The family's Christian devotion was sufficiently profound to influence their choice of religious instructors, seeking out recognized holy individuals for their daughter's formation. Documentation suggests that Hildegard maintained connections with her family throughout her early religious life, indicating that her dedication to the church did not sever familial bonds. The noble status of her birth would prove instrumental in her later ability to navigate ecclesiastical hierarchies and establish independent monastic foundations.

Hildegard's early manifestation of mystical experiences created both wonder and concern within her family circle, as visions beginning at age three were unprecedented in their household's experience. Her frequent childhood illnesses, particularly severe headaches that accompanied her visions, prompted her parents to seek both medical and spiritual guidance for their unusual daughter. The family's decision to entrust her care to Jutta von Sponheim when Hildegard was eight years old reflected their recognition that conventional education would be insufficient for their visionary child. Jutta herself came from the highest levels of German nobility, being the daughter of a count, which indicates the von Bermersheim family's ability to secure connections with the most prestigious religious figures of their time. The arrangement with Jutta represented a form of spiritual patronage that bound the two noble families in religious alliance, a common practice among medieval aristocracy. Hildegard's parents' willingness to place their daughter under Jutta's guidance at such a young age demonstrates their commitment to providing her with the most distinguished religious education available. The family's continued financial support of Hildegard's religious vocation suggests their prosperity extended beyond mere landed wealth to include liquid assets necessary for sustaining monastic life. Records indicate that the von Bermersheim family maintained their noble status throughout Hildegard's lifetime, providing her with connections to the German aristocracy that would prove crucial in her later ecclesiastical career.
