<h1 id="bartolomeo-bulgarini-a-comprehensive-academic-biography">Bartolomeo Bulgarini: A Comprehensive Academic Biography</h1>

<p>Bartolomeo Bulgarini, also known as Bulgarino or Bologhini, was born in Siena circa 1300-1310, emerging from one of the city’s most distinguished noble families during a period of exceptional artistic flourishing in the Tuscan republic. The exact date and precise circumstances of his birth remain obscured by the passage of centuries, though documentary evidence firmly establishes his presence as an active artist by 1337, when early sources mention payments for his artistic services to the Sienese commune. His birthplace, Siena, was at this time one of the most prosperous and culturally vibrant city-states in Italy, governed by the oligarchic Council of Nine and renowned for its distinctive school of painting that rivaled Florence in sophistication and innovation. The painter would spend virtually his entire life within the walls of this remarkable city, becoming one of the most celebrated artistic figures of his generation. Unlike many of his contemporaries who sought commissions beyond their native territories, Bulgarini enjoyed sufficient patronage and prestige within Siena to sustain a long and productive career without the necessity of extensive travel. His longevity as an artist, spanning from the 1330s through the 1370s, allowed him to witness and survive the catastrophic Black Death of 1348, an event that would fundamentally reshape the artistic landscape of Siena. The painter died on September 4, 1378, in his residence located in the parish of San Pietro a Ovile, having spent his final years as an oblate at the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala. His death marked the end of an era, as he was among the last direct inheritors of the grand Sienese painting tradition established in the early Trecento. The circumstances surrounding his death are not documented in surviving records, though his advanced age suggests natural causes. His passing was noted in contemporary chronicles, testament to his continued prominence in Sienese cultural life until the very end.<sup id="fnref:1_1"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_3"><a href="#fn:1_3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="family">Family</h2>

<p>Bartolomeo Bulgarini descended from a prominent Sienese noble family whose members had played significant roles in the governance and civic life of the republic for generations before his birth. The Bulgarini family held a position of considerable social standing within the complex hierarchy of Sienese society, where distinctions between the old nobility, the wealthy merchant class, and the popolo were carefully maintained and jealously guarded. Several members of his family had been elected to serve on the Council of Nine, the central governing body of Siena that wielded executive power and directed the city’s affairs during its most prosperous period. This council, known as the Governo dei Nove, was established in 1287 and consisted of nine members drawn primarily from the merchant class who cooperated with the aristocracy, serving terms of only two months to prevent corruption. The Bulgarini family’s representation on this council indicates their acceptance within the ruling elite and their active participation in the political life of the commune. Such family connections would prove invaluable to Bartolomeo’s artistic career, providing him with access to the most prestigious patrons and commissions from the very beginning of his professional life. The social capital accumulated by his family opened doors that might otherwise have remained closed to artists of lesser pedigree, regardless of their talent. The painter’s noble birth distinguished him from many of his contemporaries in the Sienese artistic community, who typically emerged from artisan families and worked their way up through guild structures. His family maintained a household in the parish of San Pietro a Ovile, where Bartolomeo would reside for most of his adult life with his wife, establishing deep roots in this particular district of the city. The family’s wealth and status allowed the young Bartolomeo to receive an education appropriate to his station before pursuing his artistic vocation.<sup id="fnref:1_2:1"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:1"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_7"><a href="#fn:1_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:1"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The Bulgarini household maintained properties and estates in the Sienese contado, the rural territory surrounding and subject to the city, which provided income and agricultural produce to support the family’s urban lifestyle. Documentary evidence reveals that Bartolomeo inherited or acquired landed property during his lifetime, possessions he would eventually donate to the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala in 1370 while retaining usufruct rights for his wife and daughter. This generous donation, comprising both real estate and agricultural holdings, demonstrates the considerable wealth the painter had accumulated through his successful career and family inheritance. The existence of a daughter in the documentary record indicates that Bartolomeo married and fathered at least one child, though the identity of his wife and the details of his marriage remain frustratingly absent from surviving sources. His wife is mentioned in connection with their joint entry as oblates into the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala in 1363 or 1366, suggesting a partnership in both secular and religious aspects of life. The couple’s decision to become oblates together represents a significant spiritual commitment and a practical arrangement that would provide for their care in old age. The family residence in the San Pietro a Ovile district placed them in a respectable neighborhood with its own parish church, where Bulgarini would eventually execute important commissions. His daughter’s presence in the 1370 property donation document suggests she survived to adulthood, though whether she married or pursued a religious vocation remains unknown. The provisions ensuring that both wife and daughter would enjoy the usufruct of the donated properties throughout their lives indicates Bulgarini’s care for his family’s financial security even as he prepared for death. The painter’s noble lineage, combined with the wealth generated by his artistic success, allowed him to provide well for his dependents and to engage in significant acts of charitable donation.<sup id="fnref:1_8"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:2"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:2"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="patrons">Patrons</h2>

<p>The Commune of Siena stood as Bartolomeo Bulgarini’s most important and prestigious patron throughout his career, commissioning works that served both liturgical and civic functions in the heart of the republic. The earliest documented commission from the commune dates to 1338, when Bulgarini received payment for painting the cover of a Biccherna register, the elaborately decorated wooden panels that bound the books recording the city’s financial transactions. These Biccherna covers represented a unique Sienese tradition of transforming accounting ledgers into works of art, with the commune regularly employing the city’s finest painters to create these decorative bindings. Bulgarini executed at least three of these Biccherna covers, receiving commissions in 1338, 1341, and 1342, demonstrating his early establishment as a painter deemed worthy of official civic patronage. A surviving Biccherna panel from the first semester of 1351, preserved in the Archivio di Stato di Siena, displays the characteristic style that would become associated with Bulgarini’s mature work. The decision to entrust these commissions to Bulgarini, rather than to other available painters, reflects the confidence the commune’s officials placed in his artistic abilities from the very beginning of his career. His family’s connections to the Council of Nine undoubtedly facilitated these early opportunities, but the continued commissions demonstrate that his work satisfied the exacting standards of his patrons. The Biccherna covers served not merely as decoration but as public statements of the commune’s sophistication and commitment to artistic excellence in even the most mundane administrative functions. The tradition of commissioning these covers from major artists including Duccio, Ambrogio Lorenzetti, and Giovanni di Paolo places Bulgarini in distinguished company. Through these relatively small but highly visible works, the painter established his reputation and demonstrated his mastery of the technical and aesthetic demands of Sienese panel painting.<sup id="fnref:1_5:3"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_10"><a href="#fn:1_10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:2"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:3"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>The Commune of Siena commissioned from Bulgarini one of the four altarpieces depicting the patron saints of the city, a project of immense civic and religious significance that placed him alongside the greatest masters of the Sienese school. The St. Victor Altarpiece, executed between 1348 and 1350, was intended for Siena Cathedral and formed part of a carefully coordinated program that included altarpieces by Simone Martini (St. Ansanus), Ambrogio Lorenzetti (St. Crescentius), and Pietro Lorenzetti (St. Savinus). These four altarpieces surrounded the Maestà of Duccio, the cathedral’s principal religious image and the supreme masterpiece of Sienese painting, establishing a visual hierarchy that placed the city’s patron saints in dialogue with the enthroned Virgin. The commission to execute one of these altarpieces represented the highest honor the commune could bestow upon a painter, acknowledging Bulgarini as the equal of masters whose reputations were already firmly established. The project’s coordination across multiple artists and its prominent placement in the cathedral demonstrate the commune’s sophisticated approach to artistic patronage and its understanding of how visual imagery could express civic identity and religious devotion simultaneously. A 1347-1350 Pistoiese document reveals that Bulgarini was recommended alongside Taddeo Gaddi, Andrea Orcagna, Nardo di Cione, and Iacopo di Mino for a commission in the church of San Giovanni Fuorcivitas, indicating his reputation had spread beyond Siena and that he was considered comparable to the leading Florentine masters of the day. The St. Victor Altarpiece, though later dismembered and dispersed, represents the pinnacle of Bulgarini’s achievement in the service of communal patronage. An inventory compiled by the Sienese historian Guigurta Tommasi in 1591 definitively attributed this work to Bulgarini, preserving the memory of his authorship even as the physical altarpiece was being removed from its original location. The commune’s willingness to entrust such a prestigious commission to Bulgarini, rather than seeking a more established master from outside the city, demonstrates both confidence in local talent and the painter’s own proven abilities. This pattern of communal patronage continued throughout Bulgarini’s career, with payments in 1345 and 1349 for unspecified paintings further documenting the ongoing relationship between artist and civic authority.<sup id="fnref:1_11"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_12"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:3"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:4"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala emerged as Bulgarini’s most significant patron during the latter part of his career, a relationship that deepened from professional engagement to spiritual commitment when the painter became an oblate of the institution in 1363 or 1366. Santa Maria della Scala ranked among the most important and wealthy charitable institutions in medieval Europe, functioning not merely as a hospital but as a major economic and social force within Siena. The hospital’s administrators commissioned two significant altarpieces from Bulgarini for the church of the Santissima Annunziata, which served the spiritual needs of the institution’s residents, staff, and benefactors. The first of these altarpieces, signed and dated 1371, was noted by the chronicler Neri di Donato in his Cronaca Senese, indicating the work’s importance and the prominence of both artist and patron. The second altarpiece remained incomplete at the time of Bulgarini’s death in 1378, requiring completion by another painter, possibly Andrea Vanni, demonstrating that the artist continued working until his final illness prevented him from fulfilling his obligations. These commissions likely included polyptych panels depicting the Madonna with Child in throne, now preserved in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Siena (inv. 76), as well as representations of St. Gregory the Great (inv. 59), St. John the Evangelist (inv. 75), St. Peter (inv. 1890 n. 6137), and St. John the Baptist (inv. 6137), all originally from the hospital’s church. The hospital also commissioned from Bulgarini a remarkable panel depicting the Assumption of the Virgin with Doubting Thomas, painted in the early 1360s for a chapel constructed to house important Byzantine relics acquired from Constantinople. These relics included the Virgin’s girdle or belt, which according to tradition she cast down to Thomas as proof of her bodily assumption into heaven, and the chapel’s construction represented a major civic and religious investment by both the hospital and the Sienese government. Bulgarini’s panel illustrating this sacred narrative served not merely as decoration but as a theological statement about the authenticity and importance of the relics housed within the chapel. The artist’s unusual compositional choice to depict Thomas with his back to the viewer may reflect the position of worshippers and Sienese officials venerating the Virgin and the newly acquired relics.<sup id="fnref:1_4:1"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_13"><a href="#fn:1_13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:4"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:1"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:5"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="painting-style">Painting Style</h2>

<p>Bartolomeo Bulgarini worked firmly within the tradition of the Sienese school of painting, executing his works in the Italo-Byzantine style on gold grounds that characterized Sienese artistic production throughout the Trecento. His technical approach centered on tempera painting on wooden panels, a medium that demanded meticulous preparation of the support, careful application of gold leaf, and the building up of forms through successive layers of translucent color. The artist demonstrated particular mastery in the creation of elaborately tooled and punched gold backgrounds, employing techniques refined in the workshop of Simone Martini to create decorative patterns of exceptional sophistication. His figures typically occupy shallow spatial environments, with limited architectural or landscape elements to suggest depth, maintaining the fundamentally planar aesthetic that distinguished Sienese painting from the more volumetric approaches being developed in Florence. Bulgarini employed the traditional Sienese palette, favoring rich garnet reds, deep blues derived from expensive ultramarine pigment, and touches of brilliant green, all set against fields of burnished gold that create an otherworldly, sacred atmosphere. His compositions demonstrate careful attention to symmetry and balance, with figures arranged in hierarchical relationships that emphasize theological rather than naturalistic principles of organization. The artist showed progressive interest in ornamental elaboration as his career developed, incorporating increasingly complex patterns of pastiglia (raised and gilded gesso work) to create polylobe arches, haloes, and decorative borders. His painting of drapery reveals close study of how fabric falls and folds over the human form, creating patterns that are simultaneously decorative and descriptive of the body beneath. The faces of his figures display the elongated proportions and stylized features characteristic of Sienese painting, with almond-shaped eyes, delicate noses, and small mouths that convey spiritual refinement rather than individual portraiture. Throughout his career, Bulgarini maintained an archaizing tendency, continuing to reference models developed in the immediate aftermath of Duccio’s innovations even in his mature works of the 1360s and 1370s.<sup id="fnref:1_14"><a href="#fn:1_14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_3:1"><a href="#fn:1_3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_15"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_16"><a href="#fn:1_16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:5"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:2"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:2"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The reconstruction of Bulgarini’s artistic personality has been complicated by the fact that his works were long attributed to two different anonymous masters: “Ugolino Lorenzetti” and the “Master of the Ovile Madonna,” composite identities constructed by art historians attempting to group stylistically related paintings in the absence of documentary evidence. Bernard Berenson created the name “Ugolino Lorenzetti” in 1917, attaching it to nine paintings that he believed demonstrated stylistic similarities to both Ugolino di Nerio and Pietro Lorenzetti, suggesting they were by a single unknown Sienese artist. Ernst Dewald later separated six of these paintings, attributing them to yet another anonymous master whom he called the “Master of the Ovile Madonna” based on a painting preserved in the church of San Pietro a Ovile. Millard Meiss argued in 1931 that these two supposed masters were actually one and the same artist, and by 1936 he had identified this artist as Bartolomeo Bulgarini based on documentary, stylistic, and circumstantial evidence. The only securely autographed work by Bulgarini is the St. Victor Altarpiece in Siena Cathedral, which was definitively attributed to him by Tommasi’s late sixteenth-century inventory. This single authenticated work has served as the touchstone for attributing other paintings to Bulgarini, though scholarly debate continues about the precise extent of his oeuvre. The artist’s style evolved considerably over his four-decade career, with distinct early, middle, and late phases identifiable through careful stylistic analysis. His earliest works, including a triptych from the church of San Giovanni Battista in Fogliano and elements of the polyptych now in the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce in Florence, display more nervous and tormented figures with an expressive intensity that would later be tempered. The middle period, to which the Washington Saint Catherine of Alexandria belongs, shows a quest for grandeur, simplification of form, and powerful emotional expression in the spirit of Pietro Lorenzetti’s early maturity. His late works, produced in the years around and after 1360, demonstrate increased refinement in ornamental details and a continuing commitment to the formal language established by the previous generation of Sienese masters. The challenge of reconstructing Bulgarini’s artistic development from unsigned works has led to ongoing scholarly discussion, with some paintings moving in and out of his accepted oeuvre as new evidence and interpretations emerge.<sup id="fnref:1_3:2"><a href="#fn:1_3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_15:1"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:6"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:4"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:3"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:3"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:6"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Bulgarini was almost exclusively a panel painter, a specialization that was relatively rare among fourteenth-century Sienese artists, who typically worked across multiple media including fresco, manuscript illumination, and decorative arts. This concentration on panel painting allowed him to develop exceptional technical mastery in the complex processes required for this medium, from the preparation and gessoing of wooden supports to the application and burnishing of gold leaf and the final painting in egg tempera. The artist may have completed manuscripts or frescoes that remain unattributed or were painted over, but no such works have yet been discovered or convincingly attributed to him. His panels typically feature carefully constructed painted surfaces with multiple layers of color built up to create subtle modulations of tone and the illusion of three-dimensional form within the constraints of the essentially two-dimensional Sienese aesthetic. The gold grounds that characterize his work were not simply flat surfaces but were elaborately worked with punches and incising tools to create patterns that catch and reflect light, animating the surface and creating an effect of luminous splendor. Bulgarini demonstrated particular skill in the rendering of textiles, depicting the rich brocades, embroidered borders, and sumptuous fabrics that dress his sacred figures with an attention to detail that reveals both technical virtuosity and sensitivity to the material culture of his time. His architectural elements, when they appear, typically take the form of stylized thrones, abbreviated buildings, or decorative frames rather than fully developed spatial environments, maintaining the iconic character of Sienese religious imagery. The artist employed a limited range of facial types, repeating certain physiognomic formulas across different figures and compositions in a manner typical of medieval workshop practice. His predella panels, the small narrative scenes that formed the lower register of altarpieces, demonstrate his ability to work at a smaller scale and to construct legible narrative compositions with multiple figures interacting in defined spaces. The technical quality of Bulgarini’s panels remained consistently high throughout his career, indicating that he maintained a well-organized workshop with access to the finest materials and skilled assistants to prepare supports and grind pigments.<sup id="fnref:1_17"><a href="#fn:1_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_15:2"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:7"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:5"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:4"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:4"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_11:1"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="artistic-influences">Artistic Influences</h2>

<p>Duccio di Buoninsegna, the founding master of the Sienese school whose Maestà altarpiece transformed the cathedral and established the paradigm for subsequent Sienese painting, exerted a profound and lasting influence on Bulgarini’s artistic formation and practice. Although Duccio died around 1318-1319, well before Bulgarini began his career, the younger artist absorbed the formal language and aesthetic principles that Duccio had established through careful study of works by the master and his immediate followers. The Maestà itself, which Bulgarini would have encountered regularly in the cathedral and which he was paid to help relocate in 1362, provided an inexhaustible source of compositional models, figure types, and technical approaches. Duccio’s synthesis of Byzantine icon painting traditions with Gothic linear elegance created a distinctive Sienese style that emphasized spiritual refinement, decorative elaboration, and emotional expressiveness rather than the naturalistic volumetric modeling being pursued by Florentine artists. Bulgarini maintained his allegiance to this Ducciesque tradition throughout his career, even in his mature and late works continuing to reference models developed in the immediate aftermath of the master’s innovations. The elongated proportions, delicate features, and graceful poses of Bulgarini’s figures derive ultimately from Duccio’s figure canon, filtered through the interpretations of subsequent artists. Duccio’s approach to gold ground painting, with its elaborate tooling and punching to create decorative patterns, provided the technical foundation that Bulgarini would develop to even greater levels of sophistication. The older master’s narrative panels on the back of the Maestà, with their clear storytelling and careful attention to gesture and expression, influenced how Bulgarini constructed his own predella scenes. Duccio’s color harmonies, with their preference for rich, jewel-like hues carefully balanced against expanses of gold, established the chromatic principles that Bulgarini followed in his own works. Even as Bulgarini absorbed influences from other masters, particularly Pietro Lorenzetti, the fundamental Ducciesque character of his art remained constant, marking him as a conservative force dedicated to preserving and transmitting the great tradition of early Trecento Sienese painting.<sup id="fnref:1_15:3"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:8"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:5"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:5"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:7"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_11:2"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_17:1"><a href="#fn:1_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

<p>Pietro Lorenzetti exercised the most direct and formative influence on Bulgarini’s artistic development, with documentary evidence and stylistic analysis both indicating that the younger artist entered Pietro’s workshop as an apprentice or assistant. This master-apprentice relationship, mentioned by Giorgio Vasari and supported by the obvious stylistic affinities between their works, would have provided Bulgarini with intensive training in all aspects of panel painting technique and composition. Pietro Lorenzetti, along with his brother Ambrogio, represented the most progressive tendency within Sienese painting during the 1320s and 1330s, introducing greater spatial depth, emotional intensity, and narrative complexity than had been seen in earlier Sienese works. Under Pietro’s tutelage, Bulgarini learned to construct figures with greater volumetric presence and to arrange them within more convincing spatial environments, though he never fully embraced the radical innovations of his master. The influence of Pietro Lorenzetti is particularly evident in Bulgarini’s handling of drapery, where the complex folds and the way fabric responds to the body beneath clearly derives from Pietro’s example. Bulgarini’s quest for grandeur and monumental form in his middle period works, such as the Washington Saint Catherine, reflects the powerful emotional expression characteristic of Pietro’s early maturity. The apprenticeship in Pietro’s workshop would have exposed Bulgarini to the collaborative nature of altarpiece production, teaching him how to coordinate multiple panels within a unified program and how to organize a workshop to execute large commissions efficiently. Pietro Lorenzetti’s tragic death in the Black Death of 1348 left Bulgarini as one of the principal inheritors of his artistic legacy and created the circumstances that would allow the younger artist to emerge as one of the leading painters in post-plague Siena. The scholarly identification of Bulgarini with the works formerly attributed to “Ugolino Lorenzetti” reflects the close relationship between his style and that of Pietro, as Bernard Berenson’s invented name itself indicates the perceived connection to the Lorenzetti tradition. Bulgarini synthesized Pietro’s innovations with the more conservative Ducciesque tradition, creating a personal style that mediated between tradition and innovation. Giorgio Vasari’s statement that Bulgarini was among Pietro Lorenzetti’s pupils, and that he copied his master’s portrait “in una tavola in Siena,” preserves the memory of this crucial relationship even as many specific details have been lost.<sup id="fnref:1_9:1"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_18"><a href="#fn:1_18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_19"><a href="#fn:1_19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:9"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:6"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_3:3"><a href="#fn:1_3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:6"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:8"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_15:4"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p>

<p>Ugolino di Nerio, a painter active in the early decades of the fourteenth century and a close follower of Duccio, provided another significant influence on Bulgarini’s stylistic formation, particularly in the early phases of his career. The synthetic name “Ugolino Lorenzetti” invented by Bernard Berenson explicitly acknowledged the combination of influences from both Ugolino di Nerio and Pietro Lorenzetti that characterizes Bulgarini’s work. Ugolino di Nerio’s paintings, with their sweet, delicate figure types and refined decorative sense, represented a more conservative tendency within Sienese painting, maintaining closer fidelity to Duccio’s example than the more innovative approaches of the Lorenzetti brothers. Bulgarini absorbed from Ugolino’s works a particular approach to painting facial features, with their elongated proportions, downcast eyes, and expressions of quiet devotion that convey spiritual interiority. The graceful linearity and rhythmic compositions characteristic of Ugolino’s altarpieces provided models that Bulgarini adapted and transformed in his own works. This dual inheritance from both the conservative Ugolino tradition and the more progressive Pietro Lorenzetti workshop created a certain tension in Bulgarini’s art, as he attempted to synthesize these different approaches into a coherent personal style. His success in achieving this synthesis explains why his works were long attributed to the fictional “Ugolino Lorenzetti,” as scholars recognized the presence of both influences without being able to identify the historical artist responsible. The influence of Ugolino di Nerio is perhaps most evident in Bulgarini’s treatment of the Madonna and Child theme, where the tender relationship between mother and infant and the decorative elaboration of their garments recall Ugolino’s approach to this subject. Bulgarini’s archaizing tendency, his continued reference to early Trecento models even in his mature works of the 1360s and 1370s, reflects the enduring impact of the Ugolino tradition and its commitment to preserving the fundamental character of Ducciesque painting. The careful balance between linear elegance and volumetric modeling in Bulgarini’s figures demonstrates his attempt to reconcile the Ugolino and Lorenzetti influences into a unified artistic language. Through this synthesis, Bulgarini positioned himself as a bridge between generations, carrying forward the achievements of the early Trecento masters into the changed world that emerged after the Black Death.<sup id="fnref:1_20"><a href="#fn:1_20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_21"><a href="#fn:1_21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:10"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:6"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_3:4"><a href="#fn:1_3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:7"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Simone Martini, the most internationally celebrated Sienese painter of the early fourteenth century and a master of Gothic linear elegance and refined courtly style, exercised significant influence on Bulgarini’s approach to ornamental elaboration and decorative refinement. Simone had developed sophisticated techniques for creating elaborate decorative effects through the use of pastiglia (raised and gilded gesso work), punch tools, and incised patterns that transformed gold grounds into shimmering fields of light and texture. Bulgarini absorbed these techniques and progressively increased their use in his own works, particularly in his mature period, when his panels display increasingly complex ornamental borders, haloes, and architectural details. The refined elegance of Simone’s figure style, with its emphasis on graceful poses, flowing draperies, and courtly sophistication, provided an alternative model to the more monumental and emotionally intense approach of Pietro Lorenzetti. Bulgarini’s middle and late period works show evidence of careful study of Simone’s achievements, particularly in the rendering of costly textiles, brocaded fabrics, and the material luxury appropriate to sacred figures. The St. Victor Altarpiece commission placed Bulgarini in direct dialogue with Simone Martini’s earlier St. Ansanus Altarpiece, as both works were part of the coordinated program of patron saint altarpieces surrounding Duccio’s Maestà in the cathedral. This proximity would have encouraged Bulgarini to study Simone’s compositional solutions and technical approaches carefully, learning from the master’s handling of similar themes and formats. Simone Martini’s international career, which took him to Naples, Assisi, Avignon, and other centers, demonstrated the potential for Sienese painting to achieve recognition beyond the city’s walls, though Bulgarini himself chose not to pursue such opportunities. The decorative sophistication and refined elegance that characterized Simone’s work at the papal court in Avignon represented the highest achievement of Sienese Gothic style, setting a standard that subsequent painters sought to emulate. Bulgarini’s increasing interest in ornamental elaboration as his career progressed reflects his study of the techniques perfected in Simone’s workshop, even as he maintained his fundamental allegiance to the more conservative Ducciesque tradition. The synthesis of influences from Duccio, Pietro Lorenzetti, Ugolino di Nerio, and Simone Martini that characterizes Bulgarini’s mature style demonstrates his position as the heir to the great tradition of early Trecento Sienese painting.<sup id="fnref:1_1:11"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:7"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:8"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_11:3"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></p>

<p>Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Pietro’s younger brother and one of the most intellectually ambitious and innovative painters of the Trecento, exercised a more limited but nonetheless significant influence on certain aspects of Bulgarini’s artistic development, particularly in the realm of narrative composition and spatial construction. Ambrogio’s great frescoes in the Palazzo Pubblico, depicting the Allegory of Good and Bad Government and their effects in city and countryside, represented the most sophisticated attempt in Trecento Italian painting to create coherent, panoramic spatial environments populated by numerous figures engaged in complex activities. While Bulgarini never attempted works of comparable spatial or narrative complexity, he absorbed from Ambrogio’s example certain principles for constructing legible narrative scenes with multiple figures interacting in defined spaces. Ambrogio’s contributions to the tradition of Biccherna cover painting, including his surviving Allegory of the Commune of Siena of 1344, provided models for how to compress complex allegorical content into small-format panels, a challenge Bulgarini faced in his own Biccherna commissions. The intellectual sophistication and careful attention to iconographic detail that characterized Ambrogio’s work influenced how Bulgarini approached the theological and narrative content of his own paintings, encouraging precise attention to gesture, attribute, and compositional structure. Ambrogio Lorenzetti’s St. Crescentius Altarpiece, part of the same cathedral program that included Bulgarini’s St. Victor Altarpiece, provided another point of reference and comparison, establishing expectations for scale, format, and artistic quality that Bulgarini needed to meet or exceed. Like Pietro, Ambrogio perished in the Black Death of 1348, creating a void in Sienese artistic life that Bulgarini and other surviving painters had to fill. The loss of both Lorenzetti brothers at the height of their creative powers fundamentally altered the trajectory of Sienese painting, as no single artist of the following generation possessed their combination of technical mastery, intellectual ambition, and innovative spirit. Bulgarini, as one of the few major Sienese painters to survive the plague, became a custodian of the artistic traditions established by the previous generation, preserving and transmitting their achievements even as the conditions that had made them possible disappeared. His conservative approach, continuing to reference models developed before the Black Death well into the 1360s and 1370s, reflects both his training under the first generation of Trecento masters and the traumatic rupture caused by their deaths. Through his long career, Bulgarini served as a living link between the great age of Sienese painting in the first half of the Trecento and the changed artistic environment of the post-plague period.<sup id="fnref:1_10:1"><a href="#fn:1_10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_7:1"><a href="#fn:1_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:8"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:9"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:12"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="travels">Travels</h2>

<p>Unlike many of his Sienese contemporaries, Bartolomeo Bulgarini appears to have conducted his entire career within or in close proximity to Siena, with no compelling documentary or stylistic evidence suggesting extended periods of work in other cities or regions. This sedentary character distinguished him from painters such as Simone Martini, who pursued commissions in Naples, Assisi, and Avignon, or Duccio, who executed works for Tuscan cities beyond Siena’s walls. The reasons for Bulgarini’s apparent unwillingness or lack of necessity to travel in search of commissions likely relate to the privileged position he enjoyed within Sienese society due to his noble family background and their connections to the ruling oligarchy. His family’s representation on the Council of Nine and their established position within the urban patriciate provided him with access to the most prestigious local patrons from the very beginning of his career. The abundance of commissions available within Siena itself, from both communal authorities and ecclesiastical institutions, meant that Bulgarini never faced the economic pressures that forced other artists to seek opportunities elsewhere. Documentary evidence places him consistently in Siena throughout his active career, from the first recorded payment in 1337 or 1338 through his final years as an oblate at Santa Maria della Scala until his death in 1378. His residence in the San Pietro a Ovile district, where he maintained a household with his wife for most of their married life, suggests deep roots in a particular neighborhood and integration into local social networks. The parish church of San Pietro a Ovile, where he executed important commissions, stood literally on his doorstep, eliminating any need for travel even to reach certain work sites. The concentration of major artistic projects within Siena during the period of the Council of Nine’s rule, including the decoration of the cathedral, the Palazzo Pubblico, and various important churches and confraternities, created abundant opportunities for local artists without requiring them to venture beyond the city’s territories. Bulgarini’s specialization in panel painting, rather than fresco, may have further reduced any incentive to travel, as altarpieces could be executed entirely within the controlled environment of his workshop and then transported to their intended locations.<sup id="fnref:1_6:1"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_7:2"><a href="#fn:1_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:7"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:9"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:13"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The possibility that Bulgarini worked in Florence cannot be entirely dismissed, as Giorgio Vasari specifically mentions a painting by him in the chapel of San Silvestro in the church of Santa Croce, describing it as “quella che è in sull’altare”. A polyptych attributed to Bulgarini survives in the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce in Florence, potentially corresponding to the work Vasari saw, though whether this represents evidence of a sojourn in Florence or merely a commission executed in Siena and then transported remains uncertain. The physical distance between Siena and Florence, approximately fifty kilometers, could be covered in a day or two of travel, making it feasible for an artist to execute a commission for a Florentine patron without establishing a temporary residence there. Documentary evidence from Pistoia dated 1347-1350 indicates that Bulgarini was being considered for a commission at San Giovanni Fuorcivitas alongside leading Florentine masters including Taddeo Gaddi, Andrea Orcagna, and Nardo di Cione, as well as the Sienese painter Iacopo di Mino. This document demonstrates that his reputation had spread into Tuscany beyond Siena’s immediate sphere of influence and that he was regarded as comparable in stature to the most celebrated painters of the day. The fact that he was being considered for this Pistoiese commission suggests he may have been willing to travel when particularly prestigious opportunities arose, though no evidence confirms that he ultimately executed the work or visited Pistoia. The Santa Croce polyptych, if indeed by Bulgarini and executed for that specific location, represents the most convincing evidence for work beyond Siena proper, though even this could have been commissioned by Sienese patrons or produced entirely in his Siena workshop before installation in Florence. The stylistic relationships between Bulgarini’s paintings and works by Florentine masters such as Taddeo Gaddi derive from shared training traditions and the circulation of artistic ideas through portable works rather than from personal contact or travel. The absence of documented payments for travel expenses, lodging, or materials purchased outside Siena further supports the interpretation that Bulgarini’s career unfolded almost entirely within his native city. Unlike the Lorenzetti brothers, who are documented working in Florence, Cortona, and other Tuscan centers, Bulgarini left no comparable trail of documentary evidence placing him definitively in other cities.<sup id="fnref:1_22"><a href="#fn:1_22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:10"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

<p>The tradition, recorded by sources whose reliability cannot be fully verified, that the church of San Francesco in Colle Val d’Elsa possessed an altarpiece by Bulgarini suggests possible work in this small town located in Sienese territory, though the painting itself does not appear to survive. Colle Val d’Elsa lay within the contado of Siena, the rural territory subject to the city’s political authority, making any commission there an extension of his local patronage network rather than true foreign travel. The Sienese contado extended considerable distances from the city walls, encompassing numerous towns, castles, and monasteries that required altarpieces, frescoes, and other artistic works. Bulgarini may have traveled within this territory to install works or to examine sites for which commissions were being considered, but such movements would have been brief trips from Siena rather than extended sojourns or relocations. The stability of his residence in the San Pietro a Ovile district, documented over decades, indicates that any such trips were undertaken as day excursions or brief absences rather than as sustained periods of work away from home. The economic and social structures of fourteenth-century Siena, with its extensive network of subject territories and satellite communities, allowed artists based in the city to serve a geographically dispersed clientele without permanently leaving their urban workshops. The transportation of completed panel paintings from workshop to installation site required careful packing and handling but did not necessarily demand the artist’s personal presence, as assistants or specialized carriers could deliver works and supervise their installation. Bulgarini’s concentration on panel painting rather than fresco particularly facilitated this pattern of producing works in a fixed workshop location for installation elsewhere. The contrast between his sedentary career and the peripatetic patterns of many contemporary painters highlights the variety of professional strategies available to Trecento artists. Some, like Simone Martini, actively sought international patronage and were willing to relocate repeatedly in pursuit of prestigious commissions, while others, like Bulgarini, cultivated local patronage networks that provided sustained support throughout long careers.<sup id="fnref:1_2:8"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:11"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:14"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The absence of stylistic evidence for direct exposure to artistic traditions outside the Sienese school further supports the conclusion that Bulgarini’s travel, if any, was extremely limited and had minimal impact on his artistic development. His paintings consistently display the characteristic features of Sienese art—gold grounds, Byzantine-influenced figure types, Gothic linear elegance, and refined decorative elaboration—without significant incorporation of elements from Florentine, Umbrian, or other regional traditions. This stylistic conservatism suggests that his formative artistic experiences occurred entirely within Siena and that he had limited direct exposure to works being produced in other centers. The circulation of portable works, including panel paintings and illuminated manuscripts, allowed artists to study developments in other cities without traveling, and Bulgarini may have encountered examples of Florentine or other non-Sienese art through such indirect means. The arrival of foreign artists in Siena, or the return of Sienese painters who had worked elsewhere, provided another mechanism for the transmission of artistic ideas without requiring individual artists to leave the city. Bulgarini’s workshop, like those of other established masters, may have received visits from artists passing through Siena or seeking training, creating opportunities for exchange of technical knowledge and awareness of stylistic developments in other regions. The relative proximity of Siena to Florence, Pisa, Arezzo, and other major Tuscan artistic centers meant that significant works in these cities were accessible through brief excursions that would not have left documentary traces or significantly interrupted ongoing workshop production. A painter could visit Florence to study the works of Giotto and his followers in Santa Croce, Santa Maria Novella, and the Badia, then return to Siena the same day or after a brief overnight stay. Such brief study trips, if they occurred, would have provided exposure to alternative artistic approaches without constituting the kind of extended travel or work in foreign cities that left clear documentary or stylistic evidence. The fundamentally Sienese character of Bulgarini’s art throughout his career, from his earliest documented works through his final paintings in the 1370s, demonstrates that whatever limited travel he may have undertaken had minimal impact on his artistic formation or practice.<sup id="fnref:1_8:9"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:10"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:15"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The catastrophic impact of the Black Death in 1348, which killed significant portions of Siena’s population including many of the city’s leading artists, may have further reduced whatever inclination Bulgarini might have had to travel in search of commissions. As one of the few major Sienese painters to survive the plague, he suddenly found himself in great demand within the city, with far more local commissions available than he could possibly execute. The death of the Lorenzetti brothers, Simone Martini’s absence in Avignon (where he died around 1344), and the loss of numerous other established masters created an unprecedented situation in which surviving artists enjoyed monopolistic positions within their local markets. Under these circumstances, Bulgarini had no economic incentive to seek work elsewhere, as he could not possibly satisfy all the local demand for his services. The trauma of the plague years, with their massive mortality and social disruption, may have discouraged travel generally, as people feared contagion and the uncertainties of movement during a period of apocalyptic crisis. The Sienese government’s attempts to restore normalcy and continuity after the plague included continued investment in artistic projects, ensuring that local artists had abundant work rebuilding and redecorating the city’s religious and civic spaces. Bulgarini’s decision to become an oblate at Santa Maria della Scala in 1363 or 1366, binding himself more closely to this particular institution and its needs, further tied him to Siena and reduced any possibility of extended travel. His donation of his properties to the hospital in 1370, while retaining usufruct rights for himself and his family, created financial arrangements that assumed his continued residence in Siena until death. The increasingly elderly painter’s obligations to the hospital, where he executed at least two major altarpieces during his final decade, would have made extended absences impractical even if commissions elsewhere had been offered. Thus, both the practical circumstances of his career and the personal choices he made combined to create a pattern of remarkable geographic stability rare among major Trecento painters. His life and work demonstrate that artistic success and significant achievement did not require the geographic mobility that characterized many of his contemporaries, but could instead be built upon deep local roots, family connections, and sustained relationships with a stable group of patrons within a single city.<sup id="fnref:1_4:11"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:12"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:9"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:10"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="major-works">Major Works</h2>

<p>The St. Victor Altarpiece, executed between 1348 and 1350 for Siena Cathedral, represents the pinnacle of Bulgarini’s artistic achievement and his most important documented work. This altarpiece was one of four commissioned by the Commune of Siena to honor the patron saints of the city, joining works by Simone Martini (St. Ansanus), Ambrogio Lorenzetti (St. Crescentius), and Pietro Lorenzetti (St. Savinus) in a coordinated program surrounding Duccio’s great Maestà. The commission for this prestigious location, in dialogue with works by the most celebrated Sienese masters, confirmed Bulgarini’s status as one of the leading painters in the city following the deaths of many older masters in the Black Death. The altarpiece remained in situ on the altar dedicated to St. Victor until the late sixteenth century, when it was removed during renovations and subsequently dismembered, with its component panels dispersed to various collections. A 1591 inventory compiled under the direction of the Sienese historian Guigurta Tommasi definitively attributed the work to Bulgarini, preserving the identification of its author even as the physical object was being disassembled. An earlier document from 1351 indicates that the work was complete by that date, providing a terminus ante quem for its execution. The central panel depicted the Nativity, following the model established by Simone Martini in his St. Ansanus Altarpiece, flanked by full-length figures of Saints Victor and Corona. The Nativity, now in the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University, has been drastically reduced in size through cutting, losing much of its original format and compositional context. Two panels representing Saints Victor and Corona, previously attributed to the anonymous “Master of the Palazzo Venezia Madonna,” are preserved in Copenhagen and have been reunited with the Nativity through stylistic, iconographic, and technical analysis. Two predella panels, depicting narrative scenes from the life of St. Victor, survive in Frankfurt (Städel Museum) and Paris, belonging to the same ensemble. The Frankfurt panel, representing The Blinding of St. Victor, displays exceptional richness of execution and artistic quality, employing the kiss of Judas as its formal model to link Victor’s martyrdom prestigiously with the Passion of Christ.<sup id="fnref:1_12:1"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_11:4"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_17:2"><a href="#fn:1_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:16"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The iconographic program of the St. Victor Altarpiece celebrated the saint’s witness and martyrdom while asserting Siena’s devotion to its patron protectors. St. Victor, a Roman soldier martyred for his Christian faith, appears in full-length representation wearing military attire appropriate to his status and holding the palm of martyrdom. His companion St. Corona, whose martyrdom was linked to Victor’s in hagiographic tradition, appears similarly in full devotional display. The Nativity in the central panel, though drastically reduced from its original dimensions, still conveys something of the composition’s original grandeur and its debt to Simone Martini’s earlier treatment of the same subject. The predella scenes narrate key moments from Victor’s passion, translating complex hagiographic texts into legible visual narratives that would have been accessible to the cathedral’s diverse audience of clerics, pilgrims, and ordinary worshippers. The Blinding of St. Victor panel demonstrates Bulgarini’s narrative sophistication, depicting the moment when the saint’s eyes were put out before his final execution. The composition places Victor at the center, surrounded by his tormentors, with the saint’s calm acceptance of suffering contrasting powerfully with the violent actions being inflicted upon him. The formal quotation of the kiss of Judas, one of the most recognizable episodes from the Passion narrative, creates a typological parallel between Victor’s suffering and Christ’s, elevating the martyr’s witness to the highest level of sacred significance. The technical execution of this predella panel, with its carefully modulated colors, precise drawing, and subtle emotional characterization, demonstrates Bulgarini at the height of his powers. The gold ground, elaborately tooled and punched, creates a shimmering surface that removes the scene from mundane space and time, placing it in the eternal realm of sacred history. The survival of this predella panel in the Städel Museum, and the Paris panel (presumably depicting another episode from Victor’s martyrdom), allows modern scholars to appreciate the quality and sophistication of Bulgarini’s narrative painting despite the loss and dispersal of the altarpiece’s main register.<sup id="fnref:1_11:5"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_12:2"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_17:3"><a href="#fn:1_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>

<p>The Assumption of the Virgin with Doubting Thomas, painted in the early 1360s for the chapel of the relics at Santa Maria della Scala, represents another masterwork demonstrating Bulgarini’s mature style and his ability to execute large-scale compositions for the most prestigious ecclesiastical settings. The Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala had acquired a collection of important Byzantine relics from Constantinople, including the Virgin’s girdle or belt that according to tradition she cast down to Thomas as tangible proof of her physical assumption into heaven. The Sienese government and hospital authorities constructed a lavishly decorated chapel specifically to house these precious relics, commissioning an extensive pictorial cycle that was completed around 1370. Bulgarini’s large panel formed the altarpiece of this chapel, serving both liturgical and devotional functions while also making a theological statement about the authenticity and importance of the relics. The composition depicts the moment of the Virgin’s assumption, with Mary ascending bodily into heaven while the apostles below witness the miraculous event. Thomas, who according to legend arrived late and doubted the event until the Virgin cast down her girdle as proof, occupies a prominent position in the composition. Bulgarini made the unusual compositional choice to depict Thomas with his back to the viewer, a decision that may reflect the position of worshippers and Sienese officials venerating the Virgin and the chapel’s relics. This arrangement creates a surrogate for the viewer within the painted scene, inviting identification with Thomas’s initial doubt transformed into faith through tangible evidence—precisely the function the displayed relics were meant to serve for the chapel’s visitors. The panel’s scale and complexity demonstrate Bulgarini’s ability to execute ambitious compositions appropriate to the most important religious commissions in post-plague Siena. The careful attention to the theological implications of the subject matter reveals the intellectual sophistication expected of major religious art in this period.<sup id="fnref:1_13:1"><a href="#fn:1_13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:17"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Two altarpieces executed for the church of the Santissima Annunziata at Santa Maria della Scala during Bulgarini’s final years document his continued productivity and the hospital’s ongoing patronage. The first of these, signed and dated 1371, was noted by the chronicler Neri di Donato in his Cronaca Senese, indicating its significance to contemporary Sienese observers. This altarpiece probably served one of the principal altars in the hospital church, though its exact original location and the complete inventory of its panels remain uncertain. Surviving components now preserved in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Siena include a monumental Madonna and Child Enthroned with Angels (inv. 76), Saint Gregory the Great (inv. 59), and Saint John the Evangelist (inv. 75), all demonstrating the refined technique and archaizing style characteristic of Bulgarini’s late period. Additional panels depicting Saint Peter (inv. 1890 n. 6137) and Saint John the Baptist (inv. 6137) are preserved in the Uffizi, having been transferred there from the hospital’s collection. These panels formed parts of at least one, possibly two, polyptychs that originally surmounted altars in the Santissima Annunziata. The Madonna and Child panel displays the monumental scale and hierarchical composition typical of central images in multi-panel altarpieces, with the Virgin enthroned in majesty surrounded by adoring angels.

<h2 id="major-works-continued">Major Works (continued)</h2>

<p>The elaborate polylobe arches created in gilded pastiglia, the intricate punch work in the gold grounds, and the refined color harmonies demonstrate Bulgarini’s complete mastery of Sienese panel painting technique in his final decade. The Saint Peter panel, now in the Uffizi, presents the prince of the apostles holding a book and the keys to the kingdom of heaven, his traditional attributes, framed within an elaborately tooled golden arch. An unusual feature of this panel is the inclusion of a small mixtilinear compartment at the bottom, mimicking a predella and depicting a half-length apostle in old-fashioned garments, possibly James the Great. The Saint John the Baptist panel, also in the Uffizi, shows the Baptist in his characteristic camel-hair garment, holding his traditional attribute of the lamb and a scroll bearing his prophetic words. The archaizing character of these late works, drawing on models devised in the entourage of Duccio di Buoninsegna and by Pietro Lorenzetti even in the 1370s, demonstrates Bulgarini’s role as custodian of earlier Trecento traditions. The painter developed a progressive interest in ornamentation in these final works, making use of refined artistic techniques he had perfected through study of Simone Martini’s workshop practices. The second altarpiece for the Santissima Annunziata remained incomplete at Bulgarini’s death in 1378, requiring another painter, possibly Andrea Vanni, to finish the commission. This unfinished work testifies to Bulgarini’s continued professional activity until his final illness prevented him from fulfilling his obligations to his principal patron. The survival of multiple panels from these hospital commissions in major museum collections allows scholars to study Bulgarini’s late style and to appreciate the sustained quality of his work even in his final years.<sup id="fnref:2_6"><a href="#fn:2_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_10"><a href="#fn:2_10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_11"><a href="#fn:2_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_12"><a href="#fn:2_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>

<p>The Saint Catherine of Alexandria panel, now preserved in the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., represents one of Bulgarini’s most accomplished works from his middle period, datable to approximately 1335-1340. This panel formed part of a larger polyptych that has been dispersed across multiple collections, with companion pieces including Saint Bartholomew and Saint Mary Magdalene now in the Musei Capitolini in Rome, and a Madonna and Child in the Museo Nazionale di Villa Guinigi in Lucca. The Washington Saint Catherine displays the quest for grandeur, simplification of form, and powerful emotional expression characteristic of Pietro Lorenzetti’s early maturity, reflecting Bulgarini’s training in that master’s workshop. The saint appears in full-length representation, elegantly posed and richly garbed, holding the palm of martyrdom and the wheel, instruments of her passion and ultimate triumph. Her elongated proportions, delicate facial features with downcast eyes, and graceful contrapposto stance embody the refined aesthetic of Sienese Gothic painting at its most sophisticated. The drapery falls in complex, rhythmic folds that reveal careful study of how fabric responds to the body beneath, demonstrating technical virtuosity and attention to material effects. The gold ground behind the figure has been elaborately tooled with decorative patterns that create texture and visual interest while maintaining the iconic, non-spatial character of Sienese religious imagery. The panel’s excellent state of preservation allows appreciation of Bulgarini’s original color harmonies, with the rich red of Catherine’s mantle contrasting beautifully with the deep blue of her undergarment and the brilliant gold of the background. This work belongs to Bulgarini’s intermediate period, differentiated from his earlier phase with its nervous, tormented figures and from his later works with their increased ornamental elaboration. The polyptych to which this panel belonged adopted the type of multi-panel altarpiece that had emerged in Siena during the third and fourth decades of the fourteenth century, with individual saints in separate compartments unified by consistent scale, style, and decorative framing.<sup id="fnref:2_1"><a href="#fn:2_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_5"><a href="#fn:2_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_7"><a href="#fn:2_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_13"><a href="#fn:2_13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>

<p>The Crucifixion with the Madonna and Saint John the Evangelist, dated 1345 and preserved in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Siena, demonstrates Bulgarini’s approach to this central Christian theme at the midpoint of his documented career. This work follows the traditional Sienese formula for Crucifixion compositions established by Duccio and maintained by subsequent generations, with Christ on the cross flanked symmetrically by the grieving Virgin and the beloved disciple. The painting shows Bulgarini’s careful study of Duccio’s innovations while also revealing the influence of Simone Martini’s greater rigidity of forms and decorative refinement. The gold ground creates a timeless, sacred space removed from earthly contingency, appropriate to the cosmic significance of Christ’s sacrifice. The figures of Mary and John demonstrate the expressive intensity characteristic of mid-Trecento Sienese painting, with their grief conveyed through gesture, pose, and facial expression rather than dramatic action. Christ’s body displays the anatomical knowledge and attention to the physical reality of suffering that distinguished fourteenth-century representations from earlier, more hieratic Byzantine models. The date of 1345 places this work shortly before the catastrophic Black Death that would kill many of Bulgarini’s contemporaries and fundamentally alter the artistic landscape of Siena. As a devotional image intended for private contemplation or liturgical use, this Crucifixion would have functioned to focus meditation on Christ’s passion and to evoke empathetic response from viewers. The panel’s preservation in the Pinacoteca Nazionale allows it to be studied alongside other major works of the Sienese school, facilitating comparative analysis and understanding of Bulgarini’s position within that tradition. The work’s excellent technical execution and spiritual intensity justify its continued recognition as one of the significant productions of mid-Trecento Sienese painting.<sup id="fnref:2_8"><a href="#fn:2_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_11:1"><a href="#fn:2_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_14"><a href="#fn:2_14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">55</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_15"><a href="#fn:2_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup></p>

<p>Two panels depicting Saint Bartholomew and Saint Mary Magdalene, painted around 1350 and now in the Musei Capitolini in Rome, exemplify Bulgarini’s middle period style and his mastery of the devotional panel format. These paintings represent typical examples of fourteenth-century devotional imagery, in which characters are derived from traditional religious iconography with standardized attributes that ensure their immediate recognition. Saint Bartholomew appears holding the knife, the instrument of his martyrdom according to hagiographic tradition, which recounts that he was flayed alive for his faith. Saint Mary Magdalene carries the ointment jar with which she washed the feet of Christ, the attribute that distinguishes her from other female saints and references her role in the Gospel narratives. Both figures display the elongated proportions, refined features, and graceful poses characteristic of Sienese painting in the Ducciesque tradition as transmitted through Pietro Lorenzetti’s workshop. The panels were originally components of a larger polyptych that included the Saint Catherine now in Washington and the Madonna and Child now in Lucca, demonstrating the dispersal of medieval altarpieces across international museum collections. The date of around 1350 places these works shortly after the Black Death, when Bulgarini had emerged as one of the few major Sienese painters to survive the plague and was receiving important commissions from communal and ecclesiastical patrons. The technical quality of these panels, with their carefully modulated colors, refined drawing, and elaborate gold grounds, demonstrates the sustained excellence of Bulgarini’s work throughout his career. Their preservation in the Musei Capitolini contributes to that collection’s representation of central Italian painting from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance. The panels serve as important reference points for understanding Bulgarini’s stylistic development and his synthesis of influences from Ugolino di Nerio and Pietro Lorenzetti.<sup id="fnref:2_5:1"><a href="#fn:2_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_7:1"><a href="#fn:2_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_15:1"><a href="#fn:2_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_1:1"><a href="#fn:2_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup></p>

<p>The three Biccherna covers executed by Bulgarini in 1338, 1341, and 1342 represent a unique category of Sienese painting, transforming the mundane function of binding financial registers into opportunities for sophisticated artistic display. These small-format wooden panels served as covers for the books recording the Sienese commune’s financial transactions, maintained by the Biccherna office responsible for the city’s fiscal administration. The tradition of commissioning leading painters to decorate these covers reflects the Sienese government’s commitment to artistic excellence and its understanding of how visual imagery could express civic identity and administrative authority. Bulgarini’s Biccherna covers placed him in the distinguished company of Duccio, Ambrogio Lorenzetti, Giovanni di Paolo, and other major Sienese masters who received similar commissions. A surviving panel from the first semester of 1351, preserved in the Archivio di Stato di Siena, displays the characteristic style that became associated with Bulgarini’s work. The small scale and specialized function of Biccherna covers required different compositional strategies than large-format altarpieces, demanding clarity of imagery that could be immediately understood and allegorical sophistication appropriate to the commune’s dignity. The covers typically featured religious imagery, civic allegories, or representations of the officials responsible for the period’s financial administration, creating a visual record of the city’s governance alongside the numerical data in the registers. Bulgarini’s early commissions for Biccherna covers in 1338, shortly after his first documented appearance, demonstrate that he had already established his reputation sufficiently to receive official communal patronage. These works provided regular income and maintained the artist’s visibility among the ruling elite who commissioned the covers and reviewed the financial records they adorned. The survival of Biccherna panels in the Archivio di Stato’s museum collection preserves these unique artifacts of Sienese political and artistic culture.<sup id="fnref:2_12:1"><a href="#fn:2_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_16"><a href="#fn:2_16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">57</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_17"><a href="#fn:2_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">58</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_18"><a href="#fn:2_18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">59</a></sup></p>

<p>A polyptych formerly in the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce in Florence, mentioned by Giorgio Vasari as being in the chapel of San Silvestro in that church, represents potential evidence of Bulgarini’s work beyond Siena’s immediate territories. Vasari specifically described this painting as “quella che è in sull’altare,” identifying it as the altarpiece on the chapel’s altar, though subsequent removal and partial loss have complicated its identification. Components of a polyptych attributed to Bulgarini survive in the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce, though scholarly debate continues about whether this represents the work Vasari saw and whether it was executed in Florence or in Siena for later installation. The early phase to which this polyptych belongs displays nervous, tormented figures with an expressive intensity distinct from Bulgarini’s more refined middle and late period works. These emotionally charged figures suggest Bulgarini’s earliest experiments with the formal language he had absorbed from Pietro Lorenzetti’s workshop before developing his characteristic synthesis of influences. The polyptych’s presence in Florence, whether commissioned for that location or acquired subsequently, demonstrates that Bulgarini’s reputation extended beyond Siena into the broader Tuscan artistic market. The stylistic peculiarities of this early work, with its greater expressive intensity and less refined execution than later productions, initially led scholars to separate it from the core group of paintings attributed to Bulgarini. Only through careful reconstruction of the artist’s stylistic development, tracing his evolution from this early phase through the middle and late periods, has the scholarly community reached consensus about including this polyptych in his oeuvre. The work’s preservation, albeit incomplete, in the Museo dell’Opera di Santa Croce allows it to be studied alongside other important examples of Trecento Tuscan painting. Vasari’s mention of Bulgarini in connection with this work demonstrates that the painter’s reputation survived into the sixteenth century and that his name remained associated with specific works even as many of his contemporaries fell into obscurity.<sup id="fnref:2_5:2"><a href="#fn:2_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_12:2"><a href="#fn:2_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>

<p>A triptych from the church of San Giovanni Battista in Fogliano near Siena belongs to Bulgarini’s early phase and demonstrates his initial artistic personality before the development of his mature style. This work displays the same nervous, emotionally intense character as the Florence polyptych, suggesting execution during the same period of Bulgarini’s career in the late 1330s or early 1340s. The location in Fogliano, a small community in the Sienese contado, indicates that even early in his career Bulgarini received commissions from churches in the rural territories subject to Siena’s authority. Such commissions from smaller, less wealthy communities provided opportunities for young artists to establish their reputations and develop their technical skills before receiving more prestigious urban commissions. The triptych format, with a central panel flanked by two lateral images, represents a traditional form of altarpiece common throughout medieval Italy and particularly favored for smaller churches and chapels. Bulgarini’s handling of this format demonstrates his training in the conventions of Sienese panel painting and his ability to create unified compositions across multiple panels. The stylistic analysis that places this work in Bulgarini’s early phase relies on comparison with his securely dated works and with the developmental patterns observable across his reconstructed oeuvre. The preservation of this triptych, even if its original location has been altered, provides crucial evidence for understanding how Bulgarini’s style evolved from his earliest productions to his mature masterpieces. Rural churches like San Giovanni Battista in Fogliano served as important repositories of Trecento painting, preserving works that might otherwise have been lost during subsequent centuries of artistic fashion changes and liturgical reforms. The study of such works expands understanding beyond the major urban commissions to encompass the full range of artistic production that sustained painters’ workshops and served the devotional needs of diverse communities.<sup id="fnref:2_5:3"><a href="#fn:2_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>

<p>Two apostle panels preserved in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum in Cologne represent fragments of a dismembered altarpiece attributable to Bulgarini’s early period based on stylistic affinities with other works from that phase. These panels display the tormented, expressively intense figures characteristic of the artist’s initial production before the refinement and simplification evident in his middle period works. The presence of these panels in a German museum collection exemplifies the international dispersal of Italian Trecento painting during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, when European and American collectors and institutions actively acquired medieval works. The apostles’ identification relies on their attributes and garments, though the specific identities of these particular figures may be uncertain without accompanying inscriptions or clear iconographic markers. The panels’ excellent preservation in Cologne allows detailed technical analysis of Bulgarini’s early painting methods, pigment choices, and gold ground preparation. Comparative study with other early works, including the Florence polyptych and the Fogliano triptych, enables reconstruction of Bulgarini’s stylistic development and identification of consistent technical and formal features. The fragmentary state of many Trecento altarpieces, with individual panels scattered across multiple collections and continents, poses significant challenges for art historical research but also creates opportunities for international scholarly collaboration. The Wallraf-Richartz Museum’s holdings of Italian medieval painting provide context for understanding Bulgarini’s work within broader patterns of Trecento artistic production and for comparing Sienese approaches with those developed in other regional schools. Digital technologies enabling virtual reconstruction of dispersed polyptychs have revolutionized study of works like these Cologne apostles, allowing scholars to visualize original configurations even when physical reunification remains impossible. The attribution of these panels to Bulgarini, while generally accepted, demonstrates the ongoing nature of art historical research and the provisional character of attributions based on stylistic analysis rather than documentary evidence.<sup id="fnref:2_5:4"><a href="#fn:2_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>

<p>A fragment of a polyptych with provenance from Radicondoli, preserved as number 54 in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Siena, belongs to the stylistic phase associated with Bulgarini’s early maturity around 1340. This work displays iconographic formulae closely related to the figures of Saint Catherine and Saint Mary Magdalene in the dispersed polyptych with panels in Washington, Rome, and Lucca. The shared iconographic and stylistic features across these works indicate their execution within a relatively compressed time period and suggest they emerged from the same workshop using consistent figure types and compositional formulas. Radicondoli, a fortified town in the Sienese contado, possessed churches and religious institutions that commissioned altarpieces from Siena-based painters, maintaining artistic connections with the urban center. The fragment’s preservation in the Pinacoteca Nazionale di Siena benefits from the institution’s comprehensive holdings of Sienese painting, allowing comparative study within the broader context of the school’s development. The incomplete state of this work, described as a fragment, indicates that portions of the original altarpiece have been lost, separated, or remain unidentified in other collections. Scholarly analysis of such fragments requires careful attention to original panel dimensions, saw marks indicating subsequent cutting, and losses of original paint surface that might affect stylistic judgments. The attribution to Bulgarini rests on the close stylistic and iconographic relationships with securely attributed works, particularly those from his early mature period around 1340. Conservation and technical studies of works in the Pinacoteca’s collection contribute to understanding of Trecento painting techniques and workshop practices, supplementing the information available from stylistic analysis alone. The systematic cataloguing and publication of museum holdings, including fragments and works of uncertain attribution, provides essential resources for ongoing research into artists like Bulgarini whose oeuvres must be reconstructed from dispersed and often incomplete works.<sup id="fnref:2_5:5"><a href="#fn:2_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup></p>

<p>Bartolomeo Bulgarini died on September 4, 1378, in his residence in the parish of San Pietro a Ovile, having spent his final years as an oblate at the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala, the institution that had been his primary patron throughout the later decades of his career. His death at an advanced age, approximately seventy to seventy-eight years old depending on the precise date of his birth, followed a career spanning more than four decades of continuous artistic production. The circumstances surrounding his death are not documented in surviving records, though his age and the fact that he left an altarpiece incomplete suggest that failing health gradually diminished his capacity to work during his final months. His long life allowed him to witness extraordinary transformations in Sienese society and art, from the prosperous years under the Council of Nine through the catastrophic Black Death of 1348 to the changed political and cultural environment of the 1360s and 1370s. As one of the few major Sienese painters to survive the plague that killed Pietro and Ambrogio Lorenzetti and many other contemporaries, Bulgarini became a living repository of the artistic traditions established in the first half of the Trecento. His decision to become an oblate at Santa Maria della Scala in 1363 or 1366, along with his wife, represented both a spiritual commitment and a practical arrangement ensuring care in old age from one of medieval Europe’s most important charitable institutions. The donation of his properties to the hospital in 1370, while retaining usufruct rights for his wife and daughter, demonstrated his gratitude to the institution and his concern for his family’s future security. His continued productivity into his seventies, executing signed and dated works as late as 1371, testifies to his sustained creative powers and technical mastery even in advanced age. The second altarpiece for the Santissima Annunziata, which remained incomplete at his death and required another painter’s intervention, suggests that death came relatively suddenly rather than after an extended final illness that would have allowed completion of outstanding commissions. His passing marked the end of an era, as he was among the last direct links to the great tradition of early Trecento Sienese painting established by Duccio and developed by the Lorenzetti brothers and Simone Martini.<sup id="fnref:2_2"><a href="#fn:2_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">60</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_10:1"><a href="#fn:2_10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_11:2"><a href="#fn:2_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_15:2"><a href="#fn:2_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">56</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_19"><a href="#fn:2_19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">61</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_6:1"><a href="#fn:2_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup><sup id="fnref:2_12:3"><a href="#fn:2_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup></p>

<p>Given the extensive research into medieval Italian manuscript illumination and the specific interest in Sienese Trecento painting evident in past conversations, Bulgarini’s career offers particularly relevant insights into the workshop practices, patronage networks, and artistic traditions of this crucial period. His position as a bridge between the innovative early Trecento masters and the later painters who preserved those traditions through the traumatic aftermath of the Black Death illuminates the mechanisms of artistic transmission and the complex relationship between innovation and conservation in medieval painting workshops.
