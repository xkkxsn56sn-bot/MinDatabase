<p>Toros Roslin, the most celebrated illuminator of medieval Armenian manuscript painting, was born in the first decades of the thirteenth century, with current scholarship generally placing his birth between about 1210 and 1216 on the basis of the dates and stylistic maturity of his signed manuscripts. No contemporary document records the exact place of his birth, but both his language and his subsequent career firmly locate him within the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, and it is reasonable, though not demonstrable, to suppose that he came from the milieu served by the major Cilician scriptoria that later trained him. Later biographical notices and reference works tend to stabilize his dates as c.1210–1270, which accords with the chronological span of his activity between the Zeytun Gospels of 1256 and the Malatia Gospel of 1268, and with the absence of securely attributable work after the 1270s. The artist’s own colophons never provide a birth date and never situate his family in a particular town, so every attempt to define his birthplace more precisely remains conjectural rather than archival. His surname, however, already signals the complex social background from which he emerged, because in medieval Armenia fixed surnames were characteristically associated with noble or distinguished lineages. In his earliest signed manuscript he appears as “Toros surnamed Roslin,” an unusual formulation that both asserts and problematizes his family’s social position. The name Roslin does not correspond to any known Armenian princely house, a fact that has prompted modern historians to see in it an echo of Frankish or broadly “Latin” genealogy rather than of a purely Armenian clan. It is thus plausible that the illuminator grew up in a family of at least modest status, positioned between Armenian and Frankish communities, and that this liminal standing gave him early familiarity with more than one cultural code. Such a family background would have facilitated access to ecclesiastical education, to learned circles around the Catholicosate, and to the costly apprenticeship necessary to form a great illuminator. Roslin’s biography therefore begins not with a clearly documented village or town, but with the subtle social markers encoded in the distinctive surname that he carefully inscribed into the record.<sup id="fnref:1_1"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_3"><a href="#fn:1_3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>

<p>Roslin’s surviving writings in colophons allow a partial reconstruction of his family ties, and they show an artist fully embedded in kinship and clerical networks rather than a detached monastic recluse. In the colophon of the Gospel of 1260 he mentions that he has a son, a detail that at once humanizes the illuminator and indicates that he was almost certainly a married priest rather than a monk, since cenobitic monks in the Armenian Church were bound to celibacy while secular clergy often had families. This passing reference implies that by 1260 he was not only an accomplished master but also the head of a household, responsible for the economic and spiritual welfare of dependents living in or around Hromkla. Elsewhere he refers to a brother named Anton, whom he explicitly commends to the remembrance of readers, thereby extending the spiritual horizon of his manuscripts to encompass his kin. Such invocations suggest that his brothers and children were thought of as participants in the spiritual economy sustained by the Gospel books themselves, in which intercessory prayer, artistic labor, and familial obligation intersected. The sense of a closely knit family community is heightened by the repeated requests in his colophons that readers remember not only the patrons, but also the copyists, illuminators, and their relatives in their prayers. Although the identities of his wife and other children are not known, the very existence of these traces shows that Roslin conceived of his work as supporting a small circle of relatives whose lives were materially and spiritually bound up with the scriptorium. His family therefore appears less as an abstract biographical fact and more as a concrete community anchored in the liturgical and artistic life of the fortress-monastery. Through these brief but eloquent glimpses, the manuscripts transform a seemingly anonymous atelier master into a recognizable head of a priestly household. The familial voice that emerges from the colophons is discreet but persistent, reminding the historian that the production of luxury books was also the labor of a father, brother, and son.<sup id="fnref:1_6"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:1"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The notion of “family” in Roslin’s case also embraces his artistic genealogy, that is, his teachers and the circle of predecessors whose styles he absorbed and transformed. Armenian scholars have long emphasized that his formation took place in the scriptoria of Cilicia, and one study suggests that he entered such a scriptorium at the age of thirteen or fourteen, after which he devoted some eighteen years to study and travel before emerging as a mature master. Within this educational horizon, particular prominence has been given to the painters Kirakos and Hovhannes, active at Hromkla in the first half of the thirteenth century, whose miniatures share compositional and iconographic features with Roslin’s early works and are therefore considered his probable teachers. When he later asks his readers to remember his teachers in prayer, he inscribes this artistic lineage into the spiritual fabric of his books, treating apprenticeship as a form of spiritual kinship that binds generations of scribes and illuminators. The imagery of his earliest signed manuscript, the Zeytun Gospels of 1256, already displays a confident mastery of established Cilician models, which implies a long period of disciplined training within such a familial atelier context. The continuity between the works of Kirakos, Hovhannes, and Roslin shows that the Hromkla scriptorium transmitted an inherited visual vocabulary, but also that Roslin’s “family” of masters encouraged innovation and adaptation rather than mechanical repetition. Within this network of teachers and pupils, stylistic devices, figural types, and ornamental motifs functioned almost like inherited traits, passed from one artistic “generation” to another and selectively reconfigured. Roslin’s own colophons, in which personal voices, learned citations, and prayers intermingle, reveal how intensely he experienced this studio world as a community bound together by shared labor and shared devotion. In this sense, his artistic family becomes an extension of his blood family, and both are embraced within the broader spiritual family of the Armenian Church.<sup id="fnref:1_7"><a href="#fn:1_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:1"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:1"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:2"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The domestic and spiritual dimensions of Roslin’s family life appear against a background of political instability and military threat, which repeatedly intrude into his colophons and thereby contextualize his concern for relatives and companions. In the Malatia Gospel, for example, he describes the brutal capture of Antioch by the Mamluk sultan Baybars, lamenting the slaughtered and enslaved Christians and the devastation of the city’s celebrated churches. This narrative, recorded in a manuscript made as a gift from Catholicos Constantine I to the young prince and future king Hethum, underscores how closely Roslin’s familial and professional life was tied to the fortunes of the Armenian polity. One may reasonably infer that his own family was exposed to the same dangers of invasion, captivity, and displacement that he describes for the inhabitants of Antioch, and that these anxieties informed his repeated pleas for divine protection over patrons and kin. That the manuscripts continued to be treasured by successive generations, surviving deportations, wars, and genocidal violence, confirms that they functioned as repositories of communal memory for families far beyond the artist’s own. In this perspective the “family” invoked in the colophons comes to include the anonymous descendants of patrons, scribes, and readers who regarded these codices as heirlooms charged with protective power. The emotional intensity of certain scenes, such as Christ struggling under the weight of the cross in the Zeytun Gospels, has been read as mirroring the collective anguish of Armenian communities living under constant military peril. Within such a context, Roslin’s household cannot be separated from the larger familial body of the Armenian Church, whose suffering and hope he visualized with exceptional sensitivity. His texts and images thus weave intimate domestic concerns into a wide web of shared historical experience. The result is that his family story, though scarcely documented in conventional biographical terms, is nonetheless present everywhere in the affective texture of his art.<sup id="fnref:1_9"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:1"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_10"><a href="#fn:1_10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_11"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:3"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>After his death in the later thirteenth century, the notion of family extends once more, this time to encompass the pupils and later admirers who treated Roslin as the ancestor of a lineage of Armenian illuminators. Already in the seventeenth century the scribe Mik‘ayel of Sebastea refers to a Gospel book illustrated in 1262 by the “famous scribe Roslin,” revealing that his name still resonated in Armenian monastic circles three centuries after his activity. Although the colophons of his immediate pupils have not survived or do not identify themselves as such, their hands can be discerned in certain miniatures and decorations, especially in manuscripts where stylistic unevenness suggests collaborative work under a dominant master’s supervision. Modern art historians, beginning in the twentieth century with Sirarpie Der-Nersessian and followed by scholars such as Levon Chookaszian, have effectively adopted Roslin into a scholarly “family,” devoting monographs, exhibitions, and commemorative essays to his oeuvre. The erection in 1967 of a monumental basalt statue of Toros Roslin in front of the Matenadaran in Yerevan further signals his transformation into a symbolic forefather of Armenian national culture, a role reinforced by the naming of a fine arts academy in Beirut after him. Through these acts of institutional commemoration, the artist’s family expands to include the modern Armenian diaspora and its cultural institutions, which claim him as an emblem of continuity and resilience. His presumed death in the 1270s, probably in or near Hromkla where he had long worked, passed unrecorded in ecclesiastical chronicles, and the cause of his death remains entirely unknown, though the absence of any martyrdom story suggests natural causes rather than violent end. Yet the silence of the medieval record contrasts with the intensity of modern remembrance, which has retrospectively integrated him into the “family tree” of Armenian national heroes. Thus, although the archival traces of his immediate kin are scant, the extended familial constellation around Toros Roslin—teachers, pupils, patrons, readers, and modern scholars—has become dense and far-reaching. In an almost literal sense, his illuminated books have created a far-flung family of interpreters who continue to live from and with his images.<sup id="fnref:1_12"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:2"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:2"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_5:1"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:4"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:1"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Within this intersecting web of kinship and patronage, the central figure is the Catholicos Constantine I of Bardzrberd, whose long tenure as head of the Armenian Church from 1221 to 1267 provided the institutional framework for Roslin’s career. Constantine transferred the patriarchal see to the fortress-monastery of Hromkla on the Euphrates, purchased from the Frankish counts of Edessa, and there he established a scriptorium that quickly became the leading artistic center of Cilician Armenia. It was under his aegis that Roslin produced his earliest and some of his most important works, including the Zeytun Gospels of 1256, copied and painted for the Catholicos himself, and several later Gospel books whose colophons explicitly name Constantine as commissioner or intended recipient. The Gospel of 1260, now in the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, was copied for Constantine and contains a colophon in which Roslin mentions both his own son and the ecclesiastical authority of his patron, thus intertwining familial and hierarchical relationships. Constantine’s patronage was not purely devotional but also political, supporting a sophisticated visual program that reinforced the prestige of the Catholicosate and articulated unionist theological positions in relation to the Latin Church. Through lavishly illuminated manuscripts bearing his name, Constantine projected an image of the Armenian Church as both rooted in its own traditions and engaged with broader Mediterranean currents. For Roslin, this patronage meant stable employment, access to high-quality materials, and the opportunity to experiment with ambitious narrative cycles. The repeated appearance of Constantine’s name in colophons and dedicatory inscriptions attests to a close and sustained relationship between artist and patron, spanning at least a dozen years. In effect, Constantine I served as both patriarchal protector and principal benefactor of the Hromkla atelier, and Roslin’s art can scarcely be separated from this ecclesiastical framework. The Catholicos’s generosity extended beyond his own person, since he often commissioned manuscripts as gifts for princes and bishops, thereby mediating Roslin’s access to a wider circle of clients. In this way, Constantine functioned as the nodal point in a network of patronage that linked monastic, royal, and aristocratic spheres.<sup id="fnref:1_8:2"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:3"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:5"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9:1"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:2"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Parallel to this ecclesiastical patronage ran the support of the Cilician royal house, above all King Hethum I, his queen Isabella, and their children, with whom Roslin’s manuscripts are closely associated. The king and queen appear in portraits that Roslin introduced into Gospel books, where they are presented in hierarchical yet intimate relation to Christ and the saints, inaugurating a new genre of royal portraiture within Cilician illumination. Roslin painted at least two portraits of their son Prince Levon, the first around 1250 when the prince was a teenager and the second in 1262, following his marriage to Keran of Lampron, thereby visually inscribing the dynastic continuity and marital alliances of the ruling family. The Gospel of 1262, commissioned by Prince Levon during the reign of Hethum I, was copied at Sis by the scribe Avetis, illustrated by Roslin at Hromkla, and then bound by Arakel Hnazandents, a sequence of work that reflects the collaboration between royal and patriarchal centers. In this manuscript, the prince’s portrait is integrated into the sacred narrative, underscoring his role as protector and exemplar of the Christian community, and visually linking the royal lineage to the Gospel text. The royal patrons’ support for Roslin must be viewed within the larger context of Cilicia’s political position between Byzantium, the Crusader states, and neighboring Muslim powers, where visual rhetoric played a key role in diplomacy and identity formation. By commissioning manuscripts that combined Armenian, Byzantine, and Western motifs, the royal house signaled its openness to multiple cultural allegiances while asserting its own sovereignty. Roslin’s capacity to synthesize these diverse elements made him an ideal artist for such a program, and his royal portraits became a crucial medium for articulating the ideological claims of the dynasty. In return, the favor of the king and queen enhanced Roslin’s status and ensured the circulation of his work within the highest social strata of the kingdom. The close interweaving of royal and patriarchal patronage thus sustained both the artist’s career and the broader cultural ambitions of Cilician Armenia.<sup id="fnref:1_4:4"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:6"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:3"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Among Roslin’s aristocratic patrons, Lady Keran, daughter of Constantine of Lampron and widow of Geoffrey, lord of Servandakar, occupies a particularly evocative place, since her commission elicited one of the most sumptuous of his surviving manuscripts. The Gospel of 1265, often referred to as the “Lady Keran” Gospel and now preserved in Jerusalem, was copied for her after she had withdrawn from the world following her husband’s death, and it thus encapsulates both aristocratic piety and personal mourning. Contemporary descriptions and later scholarship agree that this codex is among the richest of Roslin’s works in Jerusalem, containing, besides the four Evangelist portraits, an elaborately ornamented Eusebian letter, canon tables embellished with busts and zoomorphic motifs, and an extensive decorative program linking the text to typological imagery. The patron’s name and narrative situation lend a distinct personal resonance to the manuscript, which can be read as a memorial book articulating Keran’s spiritual aspirations and her continued connection to her husband’s memory. Roslin’s art here responds to the refined tastes of a cultivated noblewoman, and the codex displays an evident interest in Western ornamental motifs and courtly fashions, which complements the more traditional Armenian iconographic repertoire. The Gospel thereby becomes a privileged site where gendered patronage, cross-cultural aesthetic choices, and intimate biography intersect. Through her commission, Lady Keran joined the circle of powerful women in medieval Armenia whose patronage of manuscripts and churches significantly shaped the visual culture of the period. Roslin’s sensitivity to her social and emotional position is reflected in the balance between opulent ornament and sober, text-centered imagery. The manuscript also testifies to the reach of Hromkla’s scriptorium, which could respond flexibly to commissions from lay patrons in different parts of the kingdom. In the figure of Lady Keran, then, one sees how individual aristocrats could mobilize the resources of the patriarchal atelier for intensely personal projects. For Roslin, such patronage broadened the thematic range of his work and offered opportunities to experiment with non-royal forms of representation.<sup id="fnref:1_13"><a href="#fn:1_13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_14"><a href="#fn:1_14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:7"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Clerical patrons beyond the Catholicos likewise played a significant part in sustaining Roslin’s activity, and their identities and intentions can be traced in the dedicatory formulas of his manuscripts. The Sebastia Gospel of 1262, for instance, was copied for a priest named Toros, identified as the nephew of Catholicos Constantine I, and this combination of familial and clerical status sheds light on the intertwining of ecclesiastical office and dynastic networks. This manuscript, now Walters MS 539 in Baltimore, is the most lavishly decorated of Roslin’s signed works, with fifteen full-page miniatures and sixty-seven smaller illustrations, suggesting both the devotional zeal and the social standing of its commissioner. Another important patron was Bishop Vartan of Hromkla, who in 1266 commissioned the liturgical manuscript known as the Mashtots, a ritual book whose cycle of images, including the celebrated “Passage of the Red Sea” and the “Fiery Furnace,” expanded the range of Old Testament subjects in Armenian illumination. Here, episcopal patronage fostered experimentation with typological schemes that linked Old and New Testament narratives within the liturgical framework of the Armenian Church. Clerical clients such as Priest Toros and Bishop Vartan demonstrate that Roslin’s audience extended well beyond the very apex of the hierarchy, reaching into the educated strata of the clergy who sought visual refinement in their service books. Their commissions also reveal the importance of familial ties within the Church, since priest Toros’s kinship with the Catholicos surely facilitated his access to the Hromkla atelier. Through such figures, the liturgical life of local communities became connected to the high artistic culture of the patriarchal scriptorium. Roslin’s ability to adapt his iconographic programs to different liturgical and pastoral needs underscores his responsiveness to the varied aims of his clerical patrons. These relationships collectively contribute to a rich picture of patronage in which piety, learning, and social prestige converge.<sup id="fnref:1_15"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:8"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_12:1"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:4"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>The final group of patrons to be considered are the modern institutions and collectors who, though chronologically distant from Roslin, have decisively shaped the transmission and reception of his works. The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which now houses four of his signed manuscripts in the Cathedral of St James, functioned as a guardian of these treasures through centuries of political upheaval. The Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, which acquired the Sebastia Gospel in 1930 from the collection of Henry Walters, became a crucial site for the scholarly rediscovery of Roslin in the United States, and the codex has repeatedly served as a centerpiece in exhibitions of Armenian art. The Matenadaran in Yerevan, repository of the Zeytun Gospels and the Malatia Gospel, plays a comparable role in Armenia itself, not only conserving the physical manuscripts but also canonizing Roslin within a narrative of national cultural achievement. The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, which holds the separated Canon Tables of the Zeytun Gospels, has unintentionally become a prominent actor in the modern history of Roslin through the legal dispute and eventual settlement concerning the provenance of those folios, a story that has drawn wide attention to the manuscript’s itinerary and to the Armenian Genocide. In each of these cases, institutional “patronage” operates retrospectively, by preserving, restoring, exhibiting, and publishing Roslin’s work for new audiences. Their catalogues, conservation reports, and digital reproductions have effectively commissioned a second life for his miniatures within the modern museum and library. Through such activities, the institutions have both honored and transformed the original intentions of medieval patrons, displacing liturgical and dynastic functions in favor of aesthetic, historical, and identity-building purposes. The long chain of collectors and curators thus extends the logic of medieval patronage into a contemporary frame. Roslin’s manuscripts, while remaining fundamentally liturgical books, now also belong to a global history of collecting and cultural diplomacy. This modern phase of patronage ensures that his art continues to generate new meanings far beyond the thirteenth-century world in which it was created.<sup id="fnref:1_16"><a href="#fn:1_16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_10:1"><a href="#fn:1_10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_11:1"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_17"><a href="#fn:1_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:9"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_12:2"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9:2"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:5"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup></p>

<p>Roslin’s painting style has long been praised for its synthesis of narrative richness, emotional depth, and formal elegance, distinguishing it even within the highly accomplished tradition of Cilician Armenian illumination. His contemporaries and later commentators alike recognized him as a master who expanded the iconographic repertoire of Gospel illustration by introducing scenes such as the Incredulity of Thomas and the Passage of the Red Sea, which moved beyond the conventional focus on Evangelist portraits and a small set of canonical episodes. The human figures in his miniatures are often described as “full of life,” a characterization that reflects the carefully observed gestures, nuanced facial expressions, and varied postures through which he conveys a spectrum of emotions ranging from contemplative serenity to profound anguish. Unlike many earlier Armenian illuminators, who tended toward stylized or hieratic faces, Roslin individualized his protagonists, differentiating apostles, saints, and lay figures through subtle variations in physiognomy and expression. His draperies fall in rhythmic, classical folds that articulate the bodies beneath without dissolving into mere pattern, and this concern for volumetric modeling links his work to Byzantine and perhaps Western prototypes while remaining distinctly his own. The compositions often occupy the entire page, yet they never appear crowded, because the artist orchestrates architectural elements, landscape motifs, and groups of figures into clear, legible structures that guide the viewer’s eye through the narrative. Even when he confines the illustration to a portion of the page, integrating it with the text block or marginal ornament, the balance between image and script is carefully calibrated. The stylistic unity across his manuscripts demonstrates a firm artistic personality capable of absorbing diverse influences without losing coherence. In short, Roslin’s style can be defined as simultaneously classicizing and innovative, reserved in its means yet bold in its narrative ambitions. This combination has led modern scholars to compare some of his finest miniatures with the best Byzantine works of the same period.<sup id="fnref:1_18"><a href="#fn:1_18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_7:1"><a href="#fn:1_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:10"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:5"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A defining feature of Roslin’s manner is his treatment of the human face and figure as vehicles of psychological intensity and spiritual drama. In numerous scenes, from the Passion cycles to the apparitions of the risen Christ, the apostles register a range of responses through their expressions—bewilderment, doubt, joy, and fear—thus turning familiar Gospel episodes into vivid human encounters. The individuality of faces emerges not only in protagonists but also in subsidiary figures, such as soldiers, servants, and bystanders, which contributes to the sense that each narrative is inhabited by a diverse cast rather than by anonymous types. His ability to depict the inward turmoil of ostensibly tranquil figures, whose calm poses belie the agitation implied by their eyes or hands, has rightly been singled out as a major innovation in Armenian manuscript painting. This approach aligns with broader shifts in late medieval art toward greater psychological realism, but in Roslin’s case it acquires a distinctly theological inflection, emphasizing the inner struggles of faith and doubt. His figures often interact through gestures that construct invisible currents of attention and response across the picture plane, binding them into relational networks that mirror the communal nature of the Church. Children and women, when depicted, are accorded the same careful attention to individuality and emotive presence as male apostles and patriarchs. Even in highly ceremonial portraits of kings and clerics, the faces avoid rigid idealization, instead conveying a quiet alertness or reflective gravity. This humanizing of sacred narrative and hierarchy contributes significantly to the enduring appeal of his miniatures. By situating spiritual drama within recognizable human affect, Roslin forged a powerful expressive idiom that resonates with viewers across cultures and centuries.<sup id="fnref:1_7:2"><a href="#fn:1_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:11"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:3"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Equally distinctive is Roslin’s command of pictorial space and page design, which allows him to integrate text, ornament, and miniature into a coherent visual whole. In the canon tables and ornamental pages, he deploys arcades, columns, and architectural frames not merely as decorative scaffolds for concordance lists, but as stages upon which human and animal figures appear, converse, or gesture toward scriptural prophecies. His innovation of placing bust portraits of prophets, apostles, or other holy figures within or adjacent to the canon arcades, sometimes accompanied by scrolls bearing their words, creates a dynamic link between Old Testament prophecy and Gospel fulfillment that is both visually and theologically sophisticated. Zoomorphic letters, in which peacocks, quadrupeds, or hybrid creatures form the limbs of initials, animate the incipit pages and connect ornamental exuberance with textual incipience. At times entire marginal zones are populated with small narrative or symbolic motifs, such as birds, flowers, musicians, or allegorical beasts, which, while secondary to the main scenes, contribute to the viewer’s sense of a world saturated with meaning. Even in full-page compositions, Roslin often structures space through layered architectural settings, rocky outcrops, or bands of sky and earth, thereby situating biblical events in a legible topography. The balance he achieves between densely worked decorative zones and calmer passages of unpainted parchment or uniformly colored backgrounds bears witness to a keen sensitivity to visual rhythm. His page designs consistently respect the hierarchy of text and image appropriate to liturgical books, but they also explore the expressive potential of the page as an integrated field. Through such devices, Roslin shows himself to be as much a designer of books as a painter of individual pictures.<sup id="fnref:1_1:12"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:4"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>

<p>Color and technical execution constitute another domain in which Roslin’s style displays both refinement and expressive force. His palette characteristically combines deep blues, often based on lapis lazuli, with vivid reds, rose tones, and warm gold, set against paler grounds that allow the figures to stand out with clarity. Flesh tones are modeled with delicate gradations that avoid harsh contrasts, lending his protagonists a gentle luminosity consistent with the spiritual tenor of the scenes. Drapery coloring often uses complementary harmonies—such as blues with orange-red linings or green mantles over rose tunics—to articulate form while maintaining chromatic unity. Gold is employed not only for backgrounds and haloes but also for highlighting architectural details, floral ornaments, and decorative bands on garments, where it reinforces the sense of luxury appropriate to royal and patriarchal commissions. Technical studies of comparable Armenian manuscripts have shown a careful preparation of parchment and underdrawing, and while Roslin’s own underdrawings are not always visible, the precision of contour and the confidence of brushwork imply a similar disciplined process. His pigments, consistent with Cilician practice, include both mineral and organic colors, whose stability over time testifies to the high quality of materials available at Hromkla and allied centers. The unity of coloristic effect across complex compositions, even where assistants may have contributed, suggests that Roslin exercised close control over palette selection and application. Chromatic choices frequently serve iconographic purposes as well, distinguishing, for instance, Christ’s garments from those of apostles or differentiating heavenly zones from earthly ones. Through such means, color in Roslin’s miniatures becomes not only a decorative delight but also an instrument of theological and narrative articulation.<sup id="fnref:1_19"><a href="#fn:1_19" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9:3"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:6"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:6"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Roslin’s stylistic originality is particularly evident in his iconographic innovations, where he both expanded and reinterpreted the repertory of scenes available to Armenian illuminators. Among the most frequently cited examples is his inclusion of the Incredulity of Thomas, a post-Resurrection episode in which the apostle touches Christ’s wounds, a subject that had not previously been prominent in Armenian cycles but which Roslin treated with striking psychological poignancy in the Malatia Gospel. In the Mashtots, he introduced the Passage of the Red Sea, visualizing the Israelites’ deliverance and the drowning of Pharaoh’s army in a manner that draws on both Byzantine and perhaps Western sources while adapting them to an Armenian typological context. The Zeytun Gospels, his earliest signed work, already reveal a yearning toward greater narrative density, as in the depiction of Christ carrying the cross himself on the way to Calvary, a rare motif in Eastern Christian manuscripts where Simon of Cyrene more typically bears the burden. Roslin also reintroduced the Lamb of God icon at a time when the Byzantine Church had rejected this symbol, thereby aligning his imagery with Latin usage and with the unionist currents associated with figures such as Nerses of Lambron. His Nativity scene in the Gospel of 1260 departs from existing Armenian models by combining the enthroned Mother and Child near a grotto with, in a reversed proportional relationship, the portrait of Matthew the Evangelist, and by representing the bodyguards of the Magi as Mongols, reflecting the contemporary political alliance between Cilicia and Mongol powers. These compositional and iconographic choices testify to an artist deeply attentive to both textual exegesis and current affairs, who used visual invention to articulate theological, political, and cultural affiliations. Through them, he transformed the Gospel manuscript into a sophisticated site of commentary as well as of devotion.<sup id="fnref:1_20"><a href="#fn:1_20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_21"><a href="#fn:1_21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:5"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_15:1"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:13"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Across his oeuvre, one can trace an evolution in style and program from the Zeytun Gospels of 1256 through the Sebastia Gospel of 1262 and the later works for Lady Keran and the Malatia community. The early Zeytun manuscript, though already highly accomplished, shows a somewhat more restrained narrative cycle, in which the new themes are carefully integrated into a still largely traditional framework. By the time of the Sebastia Gospel, Roslin appears increasingly confident in extending the number and complexity of scenes, as evidenced by the fifteen full-page miniatures and numerous smaller illustrations that narrate Christ’s life in unprecedented detail. The Gospel for Prince Levon and Keran reflects a heightened interest in royal portraiture and in the ceremonial presentation of patrons within the sacred text, signaling the maturation of his approach to dynastic imagery. The Lady Keran Gospel, in turn, reveals a pronounced openness to Western ornamental and figural motifs, which some scholars have linked to the patron’s tastes and to broader currents of cultural exchange between Armenian and Crusader elites. The Mashtots and Malatia manuscripts, with their ambitious typological cycles and emotive Passions scenes, suggest a late style marked by both technical assurance and deepened spiritual expressiveness. This progression does not amount to a radical stylistic break but rather to a continuous refinement and expansion of an underlying visual language. Observers have noted that even where assistants may have painted certain secondary elements, the overarching design and key figures retain Roslin’s unmistakable touch. His stylistic development, then, can be understood as a sustained exploration of the narrative and expressive possibilities latent in the Cilician Armenian tradition, pushed to new heights under the pressure of patronal demands and historical circumstances.<sup id="fnref:1_14:1"><a href="#fn:1_14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_12:3"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9:4"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:7"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:6"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:7"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_15:2"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:14"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Roslin’s art was shaped by, and in turn helped to shape, a richly layered field of artistic influences that extended from earlier Armenian models to Byzantine, Western, and Islamic visual cultures. Armenian scholarship has emphasized that the fundamental characteristics of his style derive from eleventh- and twelfth-century Armenian sources, especially from the illuminations produced in the great monasteries of Eastern Armenia and early Cilicia, whose compositional schemes and ornamental motifs he both adopted and reworked. The Hromkla scriptorium, where he spent his mature years, can be seen as the heir to these traditions, gathering and refining earlier practices under the patronage of the Catholicos. Within this lineage, Roslin inherited established ways of portraying Evangelists, depicting liturgical scenes, and framing canon tables, which provided the structural backbone for his own innovations. His engagement with these native models was never merely imitative, however, since he consistently individualized figures, clarified spatial relations, and enriched narrative detail. Older Armenian manuscripts thus functioned for him as a kind of visual library, from which he extracted and recombined elements according to the needs of each commission. This continuity with the past anchored his work within a recognizable Armenian idiom even as he incorporated foreign elements. In this sense, the Armenian tradition supplied not just formal templates but also a theological and liturgical framework that oriented his choices. Roslin’s achievement lies in having revitalized this inheritance at a moment when Cilician Armenia was itself redefining its place between East and West.<sup id="fnref:1_4:8"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_7:3"><a href="#fn:1_7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:15"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Byzantine art, particularly that of the Comnenian period, constituted another decisive influence on Roslin’s style, visible both in his handling of form and in specific iconographic borrowings. The classical treatment of drapery and anatomy in his figures, with their softly rounded faces and carefully modeled limbs, closely parallels the figural language of twelfth-century Byzantine mosaics and manuscripts. His Nativity composition in the Gospel of 1260, which combines the enthroned Mother and Child with the cave and supplementary narrative details, derives from a type developed in Constantinople that he adapts to his own purposes. The architectural backdrops and ornamental frames in his miniatures likewise reflect Byzantine conventions, especially in the use of arcaded structures and stylized cityscapes. At the same time, he often simplifies or reorganizes these elements to suit the proportions and narrative priorities of Armenian Gospel books. The influence is therefore one of creative appropriation rather than passive imitation. In adopting Byzantine motifs, Roslin participated in a broader phenomenon whereby Cilician Armenia, long in contact with the Byzantine world, integrated Constantinopolitan models into its own artistic vocabulary. This stylistic dialogue reinforced theological and cultural ties even as political relations between Cilicia and Byzantium fluctuated. Through Roslin’s work, Byzantine classicism entered deeply into the fabric of Armenian manuscript illumination. The result is an art that can legitimately be described as standing “between East and West,” not as an eclectic mixture, but as a carefully mediated synthesis.<sup id="fnref:1_2:3"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:16"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:9"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Equally important for Roslin were Western, especially Latin and Crusader, influences, which entered Cilicia through political alliances, commercial exchanges, and the presence of Frankish settlers. The very possibility that his surname Roslin might derive from the Scottish baronial name of Roslin (Sinclair), associated with Crusader participation in the First Crusade, encapsulates the entanglement of Armenian and Frankish genealogies in the region. More concretely, his reintroduction of the Lamb of God motif and his adoption of the four Evangelist symbols in forms akin to those popularized by Latin exegesis and Western manuscript illumination demonstrate his familiarity with Latin iconography. In the Zeytun Gospels, the use of an angel, lion, ox, and eagle in direct association with the incipit letters of the respective Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John follows the scheme associated with Jerome and Western tradition more than earlier Armenian practice. The increased presence of Western ornamental and figural motifs in the Lady Keran Gospel, noted by scholars as an index of cultural syncretism, further attests to Roslin’s openness to Western models. This Westernizing tendency has been interpreted in relation to the unionist policies of certain Armenian churchmen and secular rulers, who sought closer ties with Rome and the Latin Church. Roslin’s art, then, not only reflects but also subtly promotes an orientation toward Latin Christendom. At the same time, Western elements are consistently recontextualized within a fundamentally Armenian and Byzantine framework, acquiring new meanings in the process. His work thus offers a visual counterpart to the complex diplomatic and ecclesiastical negotiations of his age.<sup id="fnref:1_5:2"><a href="#fn:1_5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:7"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_14:2"><a href="#fn:1_14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:17"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The ornamental vocabularies of Islamic and broader Near Eastern art also left their mark on Roslin’s illuminations, although always filtered through Armenian sensibilities. The fortress of Hromkla, located on the Euphrates and at the crossroads of trade and diplomatic routes, exposed its residents to the textiles, metalwork, and architectural decoration of neighboring Muslim polities. Certain arabesque motifs, interlaced geometric patterns, and stylized vegetal forms in Roslin’s borders and initials resonate with Islamic ornament, even when they are not directly copied from specific works. Scholars have also noted that some decorative themes in Hromkla manuscripts suggest awareness of more distant sources, possibly mediated by imported luxury goods bearing Chinese or Central Asian motifs, which found their way into Cilicia via the Silk Road and Mongol alliances. These influences remain largely ornamental rather than figural, but they contribute to the cosmopolitan character of the manuscripts, which visually encode Cilicia’s position within a trans-Mediterranean and trans-Eurasian network of exchange. Roslin’s selective adoption of such motifs demonstrates both curiosity and discretion, since he integrates them in ways that do not disrupt the recognizable Christian iconography of the books. The ornamental fields thereby become spaces where cultural contact is registered in a non-polemical register. Through this subtle incorporation of Islamic and other Eastern elements, his manuscripts embody the porous boundaries and negotiated identities of thirteenth-century Cilician society.<sup id="fnref:1_4:10"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Beyond visual sources, Roslin’s art reveals the influence of exegetical and theological currents circulating in the Armenian Church, especially those associated with figures advocating closer ties with Rome. His careful reading of biblical texts, evident in the precision with which he selects and sequences narrative episodes, suggests familiarity not only with the Gospel stories themselves but also with interpretive traditions that linked them typologically to Old Testament events. The prominence of scenes such as the Incredulity of Thomas or Christ carrying the cross has been linked to contemporary concerns with faith, doubt, and suffering, themes that resonated powerfully in a community threatened by war and displacement. His use of certain symbols and compositions, like the Lamb of God or particular forms of the Last Judgment, align his imagery with Latin theological emphases, thereby reflecting the influence of unionist thinkers such as Nerses of Lambron, who argued for doctrinal convergence between Armenian and Latin Churches. At the same time, his adherence to traditional Armenian representations in other contexts underscores his loyalty to the distinctiveness of his own Church. This complex theological positioning means that Roslin’s iconographic choices cannot be understood purely in formal terms; they must also be read as visual interventions in ongoing debates about ecclesiastical identity and allegiance. In this way, patristic exegesis, liturgical poetry, and theological treatises form an invisible but potent layer of influence on his work. The synthesis of these textual and visual sources in his manuscripts highlights the intellectual dimension of his artistry, confirming that his innovations were grounded in learned reflection as well as in observational skill.<sup id="fnref:1_8:8"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_18:1"><a href="#fn:1_18" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:11"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Roslin’s formative years were marked by extensive study and travel, which played a crucial role in shaping his artistic vocabulary and widening his horizons. A concise biographical sketch suggests that he began his formal education in one of the Cilician scriptoria at the age of thirteen or fourteen, a typical age for entering such an apprenticeship, and that he then spent some eighteen years studying and travelling before fully assuming the role of master illuminator. This long period, which likely extended from the mid-1220s into the 1240s, would have offered him opportunities to visit different centers of learning and to encounter a variety of artistic traditions. Although the documentary record for this phase is extremely sparse, later accounts and programmatic statements by cultural institutions allow a partial reconstruction of his itinerary. It is during this preparatory stage that Roslin must have assimilated the diverse influences—Armenian, Byzantine, Western, and Islamic—that later coalesced in his mature style. The notion of travel here should be understood broadly, encompassing not only physical journeys but also the circulation of manuscripts, textiles, reliquaries, and other artworks that he would have studied closely. Within the itinerant life of a thirteenth-century cleric and artist, routes of pilgrimage, diplomatic missions, and commercial caravans all provided channels for cultural exchange. Roslin’s eventual anchoring at Hromkla in the 1250s did not erase this earlier mobility but rather concentrated its fruits in a stable institutional setting. His early travels thus functioned as a prolonged apprenticeship in the visual cultures of the Mediterranean and Near East.<sup id="fnref:1_22"><a href="#fn:1_22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_2:4"><a href="#fn:1_2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></p>

<p>One particularly suggestive modern narrative, echoed in documentation prepared for a UNESCO commemorative proposal, asserts that Roslin was sent to study in such cities as Edessa, Constantinople, Alexandria, Athens, and Rome, thereby mapping his intellectual formation onto a constellation of major Christian centers. While this itinerary cannot be corroborated by contemporary colophons, it is plausible in light of Cilicia’s political and ecclesiastical connections with these regions and of the demonstrable Byzantine and Latin elements in his work. Edessa, with its Syriac and Armenian Christian heritage, would have introduced him to early Christian iconography and to the Syriac manuscript tradition. Constantinople, as the capital of the Byzantine Empire, was the primary source for the classicizing idiom evident in his drapery and compositions, and it may have provided him with direct or indirect access to the latest developments in imperial art. Alexandria and Athens, although less concretely tied to his known works, stand symbolically for the Hellenistic and early Christian legacies that underpinned Byzantine visual culture. Rome, finally, appears in such narratives as the ultimate Western Christian center, whose liturgy and imagery would have informed the Latinizing aspects of his iconography, including the Lamb of God and certain Last Judgment schemes. Even if the details of this itinerary remain speculative, the very framing of Roslin as a peripatetic student of multiple Christian traditions reflects a deep intuition about the cosmopolitan milieu in which Cilician art evolved. It suggests that his style is best understood not as provincial or isolated, but as the product of sustained engagement with the widest possible range of Christian visual cultures.<sup id="fnref:1_22:1"><a href="#fn:1_22" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:18"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:9"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:12"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>In addition to possible journeys to distant metropolises, Roslin’s movements within Cilicia and adjacent regions are more securely inferred from the colophons of his manuscripts. These texts reveal that while he was based primarily at the scriptorium of Hromkla, he collaborated with scribes working at Sis, the royal capital, and produced books destined for communities in places such as Sebastia and Malatia. The Gospel of 1262 for Prince Levon, for instance, was copied at Sis but illuminated by Roslin at Hromkla, which implies a flow of quires, and perhaps of artists themselves, between the royal and patriarchal centers. The Sebastia Gospel, commissioned by a priest in that Anatolian town but produced at Hromkla, later spent centuries in Sivas before its eventual displacement during the twentieth-century upheavals, underscoring the geographical range of his manuscripts’ circulation. The Malatia Gospel likewise links Hromkla to eastern Anatolia, having been commissioned in the patriarchal seat but destined for a community further afield. Such patterns suggest that Roslin’s artistic reach extended across a broad swath of the Armenian and neighboring Christian world, even if he himself did not personally visit every destination of his books. The exchange of manuscripts, scribes, and patrons across these routes made the Hromkla atelier a nodal point in a network of cultural transmission. Within this network, local communities gained access to the highest standard of illumination, while the artist’s style in turn absorbed regional preferences and iconographic emphases. His travels within this interconnected landscape, whether literal or mediated by his works, thus played a vital role in disseminating and refining his art.<sup id="fnref:1_12:4"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9:5"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:8"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:19"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Perhaps the most poignant dimension of the “travels” associated with Toros Roslin, however, concerns the later itineraries of his manuscripts, which have journeyed through war, exile, and diaspora to reach their present locations. The Zeytun Gospels, after centuries of veneration in the mountain town of Zeytun and later in Marash, became entangled in the violence of the Armenian Genocide, during which it was separated into two parts: the main codex, now in the Matenadaran in Yerevan, and the Canon Tables, which were detached and eventually sold to a family that later sold them to the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The legal dispute over these “missing pages” in the early twenty-first century highlighted the manuscript’s status as a “survivor object,” a material witness to both cultural resilience and historical trauma. The Sebastia Gospel’s journey from Sivas to Paris and then to Baltimore, the Malatia Gospel’s path to Yerevan, and the Jerusalem manuscripts’ survival in the Armenian monastery of St James all form part of a complex cartography of displacement and preservation. Modern exhibitions, such as the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s “Armenia!” show, which brought together works by Roslin from various collections, have further extended the geographic reach of his art, introducing it to international audiences and re-situating it within global narratives of medieval art. These later travels, though temporally distant from the artist’s own life, are inseparable from his posthumous biography, because they determine how, where, and by whom his work is known. They also complete a circle of mobility that began with his own early journeys and continued through the peregrinations of his books. In this sense, the story of Toros Roslin is as much about the movement of manuscripts across continents and centuries as it is about the movements of a single medieval artist.<sup id="fnref:1_10:2"><a href="#fn:1_10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_23"><a href="#fn:1_23" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_11:2"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_17:1"><a href="#fn:1_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9:6"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:9"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_16:1"><a href="#fn:1_16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_12:5"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>

<p>Among Roslin’s major works, the Zeytun Gospels of 1256 occupy a foundational place, both chronologically and artistically. This manuscript, copied and illuminated at Hromkla for Catholicos Constantine I, is his earliest surviving signed work and already displays the hallmarks of his mature style: carefully individualized figures, clear narrative sequences, and richly integrated ornament. The codex comprises the four Gospels accompanied by canon tables, decorated initials, and a series of miniatures that extend beyond the usual Evangelist portraits to include episodes from Christ’s life and Passion. Its stylistic features, including the combination of Byzantine compositional schemes with Western motifs and the particular arrangement of Evangelist symbols, set an influential standard for later Armenian Gospel illumination. The manuscript’s later history, which saw it moved from Hromkla to Zeytun, where it was revered as a protective relic, and then to Marash, where it was fragmented during the upheavals of the early twentieth century, has been reconstructed in detail by recent scholarship and litigation. The majority of the codex now resides in the Matenadaran in Yerevan under the shelfmark MS 10450, while the eight folios containing the Canon Tables are housed at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, following a settlement that acknowledged their ecclesiastical origins. Iconographically, the Zeytun Gospels is notable for its depiction of Christ himself carrying the cross on the way to Golgotha, a rare image in Eastern Christian art that underscores the artist’s interest in emphasizing Christ’s physical burden and solitary suffering. The manuscript also reintroduces the Lamb of God motif, aligning it with Latin theological symbolism at a time when Byzantine usage had suppressed such imagery. Through these and other innovations, the Zeytun Gospels encapsulate Roslin’s capacity to transform inherited models into a new, more emotionally charged and theologically nuanced idiom. As the earliest and perhaps most programmatically ambitious of his signed works, it stands at the head of his oeuvre as both origin and touchstone.<sup id="fnref:1_11:3"><a href="#fn:1_11" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_17:2"><a href="#fn:1_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9:7"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_10:3"><a href="#fn:1_10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_8:10"><a href="#fn:1_8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:13"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The Gospel of 1260, preserved today in the library of the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem as MS 251, represents a further stage in Roslin’s development and offers particularly striking examples of his compositional ingenuity. Commissioned once again by Catholicos Constantine I, this manuscript bears a colophon in which Roslin notes having a son, thereby embedding a rare autobiographical detail into the text of a patriarchal Gospel book. Among its miniatures, the Nativity scene has attracted special attention from art historians for its original combination of elements: the Mother and Child seated on a throne near a grotto, the integration of the Evangelist Matthew’s portrait in reverse proportional relation, and the inclusion of the Magi’s bodyguards dressed as Mongols. This last feature, in which the attendants are given Mongol facial types and costumes, has been interpreted as a deliberate reflection of contemporary political realities, especially the alliance between King Hethum I and the Mongol Ilkhanate, and as an acknowledgment of the Magi’s Eastern origin through the prism of recently encountered Eastern peoples. The Gospel’s overall decoration includes canon tables, initials, and headpieces that refine and expand the ornamental vocabulary already present in the Zeytun manuscript. The balance between narrative scenes and liturgical text in this codex illustrates Roslin’s sense for the appropriate density of imagery in a book intended for high ecclesiastical use. Its preservation in Jerusalem, distant from its original place of production but within a major Armenian religious center, has ensured its continuous liturgical and scholarly relevance. The Gospel of 1260 thus represents both continuity with and subtle innovation beyond the Zeytun Gospels. It consolidates Roslin’s position as the leading illuminator of the Hromkla atelier in the decade following his earliest signed work. At the same time, it offers invaluable insight into his self-presentation and his awareness of the broader political context in which he worked.<sup id="fnref:1_1:20"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:14"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The Sebastia Gospel of 1262, now in the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore (MS 539), is widely regarded as the most sumptuous of Roslin’s signed manuscripts and as a masterpiece of thirteenth-century Armenian illumination. Commissioned by a priest named Toros, nephew of Catholicos Constantine I, this Gospel book was written in elegant uncials and endowed with an exceptionally rich illustrative program comprising fifteen full-page miniatures and sixty-seven smaller narrative scenes. The miniatures extend the Gospel cycle to include detailed episodes from Christ’s ministry, Passion, and Resurrection, rendered with a narrative clarity and emotional depth that exemplify Roslin’s mature style. Among the highlights are his representation of the Last Judgment, which combines traditional Eastern elements with compositional features reminiscent of Western depictions, and the finely observed portrait of John the Evangelist, later famous in its own right. The manuscript’s margins and canon tables are adorned with an array of zoomorphic and vegetal motifs, busts of prophets and apostles, and decorative bands, creating a visual environment that envelops the text in a continuous web of symbolic reference. Its later history, which saw it preserved in Sivas (Sebastia) until the deportation of Armenians in 1919 and subsequently acquired by Henry Walters in Paris before entering the Baltimore museum, reflects both the vulnerability and resilience of Armenian cultural heritage. Today, the Sebastia Gospel serves as a cornerstone for exhibitions and studies of Armenian art in the West, its high-quality reproductions making Roslin’s work accessible to a global scholarly audience. As a work of art, it demonstrates the full flowering of his narrative, ornamental, and technical capacities. As a historical document, it bears witness to the close ties between the patriarchal family and provincial clergy and to the long journey of Armenian manuscripts through exile and collecting. Its status as the “most sumptuous” of Roslin’s signed works is thus justified both aesthetically and historically.<sup id="fnref:1_24"><a href="#fn:1_24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_6:10"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_16:2"><a href="#fn:1_16" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_12:6"><a href="#fn:1_12" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:21"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>A distinct but closely related work is the Gospel of 1262 made for Prince Levon, now catalogued in Jerusalem as MS 2660, which reveals Roslin’s sensitivity to the demands of royal portraiture and dynastic representation. This manuscript was copied at Sis by the scribe Avetis, during the reign of King Hethum I, but the illuminations were executed by Roslin at Hromkla, and the completed book was then bound by the craftsman Arakel Hnazandents, illustrating the collaboration of multiple specialists across different centers. Its commissioning patron, Prince Levon, appears in at least one miniature, sometimes alongside his bride Keran of Lampron, thereby inscribing their union and princely status into the sacred text. The portraits are carefully staged, with the prince and princess depicted in rich attire, often under the protection of angels who hold liturgical fans above their heads, a compositional device also evident in attributed works showing the young prince. The Gospel as a whole combines the liturgical requirements of a royal chapel with the commemorative function of a dynastic register, in which the ruling family is visualized as both beneficiaries and guardians of the Gospel’s promises. The iconographic program, while not as extensive as that of the Sebastia Gospel, nonetheless includes key narrative scenes rendered with Roslin’s characteristic clarity and elegance. The manuscript’s current residence in the Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem situates it within a living liturgical context while simultaneously making it available to scholars studying royal ideology in medieval Armenia. Through this book, Roslin demonstrates his ability to calibrate his art to the expectations of secular rulers who sought to see their image reflected within the scriptural narrative. At the same time, the Gospel upholds the theological primacy of the text and its divine protagonists, ensuring that princely presence enhances rather than overwhelms the sacred focus of the manuscript. In this balance between royal representation and devotional function lies much of the work’s enduring fascination.<sup id="fnref:1_6:11"><a href="#fn:1_6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:22"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:15"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>The Gospel of 1265 for Lady Keran, housed with Roslin’s other Jerusalem manuscripts and often singled out as the richest of his works there, offers a different but equally compelling synthesis of personal devotion, aristocratic identity, and artistic innovation. Commissioned for a noblewoman who had retired from worldly life after the death of her husband, this manuscript can be read as a visual and textual articulation of her transition from seigneurial status to a life oriented toward prayer and contemplation. Its lavish decoration, which includes not only Evangelist portraits and canon tables but also elaborate headpieces, initials, and marginal ornaments, attests to both the patron’s resources and her desire to invest them in a work of lasting spiritual value. Scholars have noted that this Gospel displays a particularly strong infusion of Western motifs, from certain drapery types to ornamental patterns and figural attitudes, suggesting that Roslin here pushed his engagement with Latin and Crusader visual culture further than in earlier works. These elements coexist harmoniously with the established Armenian and Byzantine components of his style, producing a richly syncretic visual language. The manuscript’s content, while adhering to the standard Gospel text, may also include specific liturgical rubrics and commemorative notes that align it with Lady Keran’s personal spiritual practices. As a work of art, it demonstrates Roslin’s capacity to adapt his iconographic and stylistic choices to the sensibilities of a lay female patron, emphasizing aspects of tenderness, intercession, and familial remembrance. Its preservation within the Armenian ecclesiastical setting of Jerusalem has allowed it to continue functioning, at least in part, as a devotional object even as it has become an object of scholarly study. The “Lady Keran” Gospel thus stands as a testimony to the role of aristocratic women in shaping the trajectory of medieval Armenian art and to Roslin’s responsiveness to their distinctive forms of patronage.<sup id="fnref:1_13:1"><a href="#fn:1_13" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_14:3"><a href="#fn:1_14" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:23"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The Mashtots of 1266, a liturgical book commissioned by Bishop Vartan of Hromkla and known under the shelfmark MS 2027 in Jerusalem, expands Roslin’s repertoire beyond the strictly Evangelical narrative into the realm of ritual and Old Testament typology. As a Mashtots, it contains texts for various church services, and its illumination programs some of the key biblical episodes that undergird Armenian liturgical theology. Among its most celebrated miniatures is the “Passage of the Red Sea,” which depicts the Israelites’ miraculous crossing and the destruction of Pharaoh’s army, a scene rendered with dynamic movement and careful differentiation between the terrified Egyptians and the delivered Hebrews. Another striking image is the “Fiery Furnace,” where the three youths stand unharmed amid flames, accompanied by an angel, while their persecutors look on in astonishment, an iconography that resonates strongly with themes of persecution and divine protection. These miniatures reveal Roslin’s capacity to handle complex multi-figure compositions in which narrative, symbolism, and liturgical allusion intersect. The ornamental elements in the Mashtots, including decorated initials and borders, continue the stylistic traditions of his Gospel books but are adapted to the different textual structure of a ritual book. Commissioned by a bishop of Hromkla, the manuscript underscores the high level of theological and artistic sophistication expected of service books used in the patriarchal see. Its survival and continued veneration attest to the esteem in which Roslin’s work was held within the ecclesiastical hierarchy. As a key example of his engagement with typological imagery and liturgical concerns, the Mashtots occupies an important place among his major works. It complements the more widely known Gospel manuscripts by demonstrating the breadth of his thematic range and his ability to visualize salvation history beyond the narrow confines of the four Gospels.<sup id="fnref:1_21:1"><a href="#fn:1_21" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_15:3"><a href="#fn:1_15" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:24"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_4:16"><a href="#fn:1_4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Finally, the Malatia Gospel of 1268, now in the Matenadaran in Yerevan under the number MS 10675, stands as one of Roslin’s latest signed works and encapsulates many of the achievements of his career. Commissioned by Catholicos Constantine I as a gift for the young prince and future king Hethum, this manuscript thus combines patriarchal and dynastic patronage in a single object. Its miniatures include the famous “Incredulity of Thomas,” in which the doubting apostle touches Christ’s side, rendered with an intensity and intimacy that exemplify Roslin’s interest in psychological nuance and in the drama of belief. Other scenes, such as the portrait of John the Apostle and various Passion episodes, continue the narrative strategies developed in earlier manuscripts but with an added richness of detail and color. The Gospel’s colophon contains Roslin’s poignant description of the sack of Antioch by Sultan Baybars, a passage that intertwines contemporary history with the spiritual horizon of the manuscript and underscores the precarious situation of Armenian communities. Ornamentally, the Malatia Gospel displays the full range of his mature decorative vocabulary, from intricate canon tables to finely wrought initials and borders. Its placement in Malatia, a city on the fringes of the Armenian realm, highlights the diffusion of the highest quality of patriarchal art to regional centers. The manuscript’s eventual transfer to the Matenadaran, where it now resides alongside the Zeytun Gospels, situates it within the core corpus of Roslin’s oeuvre as recognized by modern scholarship. As a late work, it offers crucial evidence for the persistence of his style into the late 1260s, just before the probable end of his life in the following decade. The Malatia Gospel thus rounds out the sequence of his signed manuscripts, providing a fitting culmination to the series of masterpieces that have secured his standing as the preeminent Armenian illuminator of the High Middle Ages.<sup id="fnref:1_17:3"><a href="#fn:1_17" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_9:8"><a href="#fn:1_9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_24:1"><a href="#fn:1_24" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_20:1"><a href="#fn:1_20" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup><sup id="fnref:1_1:25"><a href="#fn:1_1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>
