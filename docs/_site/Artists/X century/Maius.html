        <section class="content"><h1 id="maius-scribe-and-illuminator-of-the-morgan-beatus">Maius: Scribe and Illuminator of the Morgan Beatus</h1>

<p>Maius, also known as Magius, stands as one of the most significant illuminators of medieval Spain, whose artistry defined the second major stylistic phase of Beatus manuscript production in the tenth century. He served as both scribe and illuminator of the Commentary on the Apocalypse now preserved as MS M.644 at the Morgan Library \&amp; Museum in New York, commonly known as the Morgan Beatus. According to the colophon inscribed on folio 293 of this manuscript, Maius executed the work at the command of an abbot of the Monastery of St. Michael, creating what would become the earliest complete surviving copy of the Beatus tradition. His death occurred on October 30, 968, at the monastery of San Salvador de Tábara in the province of Zamora, Spain, where he was subsequently buried. The circumstances surrounding his death remain undocumented in surviving sources, though it is known that he died while working on another Beatus manuscript, which was subsequently completed by his pupil Emeterius. Maius was honored by his student with the title “archipictor,” meaning master painter, a designation that reflects his preeminent status within the monastic artistic community of tenth-century León. His innovative contributions to manuscript illumination would influence generations of subsequent illuminators throughout the Iberian Peninsula. The precise date of his birth remains unknown to modern scholarship, as does the exact year he began his artistic training. Contemporary sources provide no information regarding his early life or the circumstances that led him to pursue the vocation of a monastic scribe and illuminator.</p>

<h2 id="origins-and-early-life">Origins and Early Life</h2>

<p>The biographical details concerning Maius’s origins remain largely obscure, with only fragmentary evidence surviving in the historical record to illuminate his early years. According to Spanish scholarly tradition, Maius is believed to have originated from Córdoba, the major cultural and political center of Al-Andalus during the tenth century. This attribution suggests that he may have been part of the Mozarabic community, Christians living under Muslim rule who maintained their religious identity while absorbing elements of Islamic culture. The proposed Cordoban origin would align with the broader pattern of Mozarabic migration northward to the Christian kingdoms of León and Castile during this period. Historical sources indicate that he relocated to León around 926, settling in the region where he would establish his artistic career. The monastery of San Miguel de Escalada, located near León along the River Esla, was itself founded by Mozarabic monks who had emigrated from Córdoba in 913 under the leadership of Abbot Alfonso. This connection between Escalada and Córdoba may provide context for understanding Maius’s own journey from the Andalusian south to the northern Christian kingdoms. However, it must be emphasized that no contemporary documentary evidence explicitly confirms Córdoba as his birthplace, and this attribution relies on later scholarly inference rather than primary sources. The absence of concrete biographical information reflects the general scarcity of personal records for monastic artisans of this period. Medieval scribes and illuminators rarely left detailed accounts of their lives, and what survives typically comes from colophons and institutional records rather than personal narratives.</p>

<p>The circumstances surrounding Maius’s early artistic training remain a matter of scholarly speculation, though certain reasonable inferences can be drawn from the sophistication of his mature work and the broader patterns of artistic education in tenth-century Iberia. The skills required for manuscript illumination—facility with parchment preparation, ink and pigment composition, calligraphy, figurative drawing, and decorative design—demanded years of systematic instruction and practice. Such training typically commenced in childhood or early adolescence, suggesting that Maius must have entered an environment conducive to artistic formation at a young age. Monastic houses served as the primary institutional contexts for manuscript production in medieval Europe, and scriptoria attached to major monasteries functioned as centers of both textual transmission and artistic innovation. If Maius indeed originated from Córdoba, his initial exposure to book arts may have occurred within the Mozarabic Christian community of that city, where churches and monasteries maintained scriptoria for copying liturgical texts. The Mozarabic liturgy, distinct from Roman usage, required specialized books including missals, lectionaries, and breviaries decorated according to local artistic conventions. Young men showing aptitude for fine handwork and visual design might be identified early and directed toward scribal training. Alternatively, Maius may have received his foundational training only after relocating to León, entering the scriptorium at Tábara or another northern monastery as a young oblate or novice. The timing of his migration around 926 leaves open both possibilities, as he could have been either a trained illuminator fleeing Córdoba or a younger individual who received his artistic formation entirely within Leonese monastic institutions.</p>

<p>The question of master-apprentice relationships in Maius’s formation presents particular challenges given the absence of documented predecessors in the Beatus illumination tradition whose work survives for comparison. Earlier illustrated Beatus manuscripts, now lost or surviving only in fragments, must have existed and would have provided both textual exemplars and iconographic models for Maius to study. The nature of manuscript copying in medieval scriptoria meant that illuminators worked from exemplars—existing books that served as guides for both text and images. A young scribe-illuminator in training would progress through stages of increasing responsibility, beginning with simple decorative elements like colored initials and geometric borders before advancing to figurative miniatures. The exceptional quality of Maius’s work suggests extensive practice and refinement over years of production. Technical aspects of his illumination, particularly the innovative binding media he employed for pigments, indicate either personal experimentation or transmission of specialized knowledge from a master craftsman. The preparation of pigments from mineral and organic sources required considerable technical knowledge, including the grinding and purification of materials, the formulation of binding media, and understanding of how different substances interacted with parchment surfaces. Whether Maius learned these techniques through direct instruction within a workshop tradition or developed them through empirical experimentation cannot be determined definitively. However, the consistent quality of his pigment application and the durability of his colors suggest systematic technical knowledge rather than haphazard trial and error.</p>

<p>The Mozarabic cultural context that shaped Maius’s artistic sensibility represents a complex phenomenon of cultural synthesis and preservation under conditions of religious minority status. Christians living in Al-Andalus during the tenth century occupied an ambiguous position within Islamic society, granted protected status as <em>dhimmi</em> (People of the Book) while subject to various legal restrictions and social pressures. Mozarabic communities maintained their Christian identity through preservation of distinctive liturgical practices, architectural forms, and artistic traditions that blended late antique Christian, Visigothic, and contemporary Islamic elements. The visual vocabulary that characterizes Mozarabic art—horseshoe arches, geometric interlace, brilliant primary colors, anti-naturalistic spatial representation—reflects this multicultural environment. For a young artist growing up in this context, exposure to Islamic art and architecture would have been unavoidable and indeed formative. The Great Mosque of Córdoba, undergoing expansion during the tenth century, represented one of the most architecturally sophisticated structures in western Europe, its forest of columns supporting horseshoe arches that created rhythmic spatial effects. Decorative arts produced in Andalusian workshops, including textiles featuring geometric and vegetal patterns, carved ivory boxes with intricate surface decoration, and manuscript illumination in Arabic texts, demonstrated high levels of technical refinement. Whether Maius had direct access to Islamic manuscripts or learned solely through observation of architectural decoration and portable objects remains unknown, but his mature work clearly shows knowledge of Andalusian decorative vocabularies. The synthesis of Christian iconographic content with decorative forms drawn from Islamic art characterizes the Mozarabic aesthetic and represents not superficial borrowing but rather the visual language of a community negotiating multiple cultural systems.</p>

<p>The political and religious circumstances that prompted Mozarabic migration from Al-Andalus to northern Christian kingdoms during the early tenth century provide essential context for understanding Maius’s relocation. The period around 926, when tradition places his arrival in León, coincided with increasing restrictions on Christian communities in Córdoba and active recruitment by Leonese monarchs seeking to repopulate territories recovered from Muslim control. King Ordoño II of León (914-924) and his successors encouraged monastic foundations in frontier regions as part of a deliberate policy of Christian settlement and territorial consolidation. The monastery of San Miguel de Escalada had been founded in 913 by Mozarabic monks from Córdoba under Abbot Alfonso, establishing a precedent for the reception of refugees from the south. These Mozarabic foundations maintained cultural connections to their Andalusian origins while adapting to new political and ecclesiastical contexts in Christian kingdoms. For individuals like Maius, migration northward offered both escape from increasingly restrictive conditions in Al-Andalus and opportunities for patronage from Christian institutions eager to demonstrate cultural sophistication. The northern kingdoms, though politically fragmented and militarily pressed by Islamic powers, were experiencing a renaissance of monastic culture and artistic production in the tenth century. Royal and ecclesiastical patrons commissioned churches, monasteries, and manuscripts as statements of Christian identity and political legitimacy. An illuminator of Maius’s evident talents would have found opportunities in this environment, particularly given the established tradition of Beatus manuscript production that required skilled artisans to create illustrated copies of this distinctively Iberian apocalyptic commentary.</p>

<p>The scriptorium of San Salvador de Tábara, where Maius worked during his documented career, represented a significant center of manuscript production within the broader network of Leonese monasteries. Founded by Bishop Froilán of León in the late ninth century at the request of King Alfonso III, Tábara developed into an important religious and cultural institution during the tenth century. The monastery was strategically located in the Tierra de Tábara region of the province of Zamora, an area that had been recently reconquered from Muslim control and required Christian settlement and institutional development. The scriptorium at Tábara produced not only Beatus manuscripts but also other liturgical and theological texts necessary for monastic life and ecclesiastical administration. The organizational structure of a tenth-century Iberian scriptorium would have included a hierarchy of roles from scribes responsible solely for text copying to illuminators who specialized in figurative miniatures and decorative elements. Maius’s documented role as both scribe and illuminator of the Morgan Beatus indicates exceptional versatility, as these functions were often divided among different craftsmen in larger scriptoria. The physical space of the scriptorium, famously depicted in the Tower of Tábara miniature from the Beatus manuscript completed by Emeterius, shows a multi-story structure with individual work stations where scribes and illuminators labored. Natural light from windows was essential for the precise work of manuscript production, and the arrangement of the workspace reflects practical considerations of illumination, ventilation, and supervision. Within this collaborative environment, Maius would have interacted with other scribes, shared technical knowledge, supervised apprentices, and participated in the intellectual and spiritual life of the monastic community. The reputation he achieved, reflected in Emeterius’s tribute to him as <em>archipictor</em>, suggests that he attained a position of authority within the scriptorium, perhaps directing the work of others and making artistic decisions regarding major commissions. This institutional context shaped not only the practical aspects of his work but also the spiritual and intellectual framework within which manuscript illumination was understood as service to God and the Church.</p>

<h2 id="family-background">Family Background</h2>

<p>No information has survived in the historical record regarding Maius’s family background, parentage, or social origins prior to his entry into monastic life. Medieval sources from tenth-century Spain rarely preserved such genealogical details for individuals who were not members of the nobility or royal families. The silence of the sources on this matter is particularly frustrating for modern scholars seeking to understand the social contexts that produced such talented artisans. Whether Maius came from an aristocratic family, a merchant background, or a more humble social station remains entirely unknown. The question of whether he had siblings, or whether other family members pursued artistic or ecclesiastical vocations, cannot be answered based on surviving evidence. It is possible that family connections may have facilitated his entry into monastic life or his training as an illuminator, but this remains purely speculative. Some medieval artists came from families with established traditions in particular crafts, while others represented the first generation to pursue such vocations. The Mozarabic community from which Maius may have originated often maintained strong family networks and transmitted cultural knowledge across generations. However, in the absence of documentary evidence, any statements about his family structure would be conjectural. The practice of oblation, whereby families dedicated young children to monastic houses, was common during this period, but whether Maius entered religious life as a child oblate or as an adult convert cannot be determined.</p>

<p>Given the lack of specific information about Maius’s family, scholars must rely on general knowledge of social structures in tenth-century Iberia to contextualize his background. Christian communities in Al-Andalus occupied a complex social position, maintaining their religious identity while participating in the broader cultural and economic life of the Islamic state. Families in these communities often valued literacy and learning, as these skills were essential for preserving Christian religious texts and traditions. The decision to pursue a monastic vocation that included scribal and artistic training would have required both personal aptitude and some degree of family support or institutional sponsorship. Monasteries during this period served as centers of learning and artistic production, attracting individuals with intellectual and creative talents from various social backgrounds. The level of skill that Maius demonstrated in his mature work suggests years of training and practice, implying access to educational resources from a relatively young age. Whether this training occurred within a monastic context or through apprenticeship to a master craftsman in a secular setting remains unknown. The absence of any recorded family name or patronymic in surviving sources is itself significant, as it may indicate either humble origins or the common medieval practice of identifying monks solely by their given names and institutional affiliations. The relationship between family background and artistic achievement in medieval contexts remains an area of scholarly interest, but for Maius specifically, the evidentiary gaps prevent definitive conclusions.</p>

<p>The question of whether Maius maintained contact with family members after entering monastic life, or whether he had descendants, cannot be answered from available sources. Medieval monks took vows of stability that bound them to particular monastic communities, though some level of communication with the outside world was typically maintained. The artistic networks that Maius appears to have cultivated, evidenced by his work for monasteries beyond his immediate institutional home, suggest a degree of mobility and external engagement. However, whether this extended to maintaining family relationships remains undocumented. The Mozarabic Christian communities of tenth-century Iberia maintained distinct cultural identities that included language, liturgical practices, and artistic traditions passed down through family and community structures. If Maius did indeed originate from such a community, his artistic style may have been influenced by visual traditions transmitted within family or community contexts. The characteristic features of Mozarabic art, including specific iconographic conventions and decorative motifs, were often learned and preserved through informal transmission within cultural communities. Yet without specific documentation of his family connections, such observations remain necessarily general rather than biographical in nature. The historical record’s silence on these matters reflects the broader challenge of recovering the lives of medieval artisans beyond their creative output.</p>

<h2 id="ecclesiastical-patrons">Ecclesiastical Patrons</h2>

<p>Abbot Victor of the Monastery of St. Michael emerges from the historical record as the primary patron responsible for commissioning Maius’s most famous work, the Morgan Beatus. The colophon on folio 293 of MS M.644 explicitly states that Maius executed the manuscript at the abbot’s command, establishing a clear patron-artist relationship. Scholarly consensus generally identifies this monastery of St. Michael with San Miguel de Escalada, a significant religious foundation located in the province of León. The monastery of Escalada had been consecrated in 913, making it a relatively new institution when Maius received his commission, presumably in the early-to-mid 940s. This identification gains credibility from Escalada’s known Mozarabic connections, as the monastery had been founded by monks who emigrated from Córdoba under Abbot Alfonso. The cultural and possibly personal connections between Maius and the Mozarabic monastic network would have facilitated such a commission. Abbot Victor’s decision to commission a complete Beatus manuscript represents a significant investment of resources, as such projects required extensive quantities of vellum, pigments, and above all, the time of a skilled scribe-illuminator. The Morgan Beatus contains 300 folios with 110 miniatures, representing months or even years of intensive labor. Victor’s patronage thus reflects both the wealth and the cultural ambitions of his monastic community. Such commissions served multiple purposes: they enhanced the liturgical and educational resources of the monastery, demonstrated the institution’s cultural sophistication, and created objects of lasting prestige.</p>

<p>The relationship between Maius and his patron Abbot Victor would have been structured by the conventions of medieval monastic culture and artistic commissioning. While the specific terms of their agreement are not documented, such arrangements typically involved discussions of iconographic program, textual content, and perhaps timeline expectations. The patron would have specified the texts to be included—in this case, the Commentary on the Apocalypse by Beatus of Liébana, excerpts from Isidore of Seville, and St. Jerome’s Commentary on Daniel. Whether Victor exercised direct oversight of Maius’s artistic choices or granted him considerable creative freedom remains unknown, though the innovative features of the Morgan Beatus suggest a degree of artistic autonomy. The manuscript includes elements that appear to be Maius’s own contributions, including the prefatory portraits of the Evangelists, elaborate genealogical tables, and distinctive approaches to framing and background colors. These innovations suggest that Victor trusted Maius’s artistic judgment and may have encouraged experimentation. The fact that Maius worked not at Escalada but at the scriptorium of San Salvador de Tábara, where he died in 968, indicates a complex arrangement whereby Maius remained affiliated with his home institution while executing commissions for external patrons. Such arrangements were not uncommon in medieval monastic culture, where talented artisans might work for multiple institutions within a regional network. The patronage relationship thus involved not only Victor and Maius as individuals but also the institutional relationship between the monasteries of Escalada and Tábara.</p>

<p>Alternative identifications of the patron monastery have been proposed by some scholars, including San Miguel de Moreruela, which was located near Tábara and had connections to the same ecclesiastical network. According to hagiographical sources, particularly the Vita Sancti Froilani contained in the Visigothic Bible of León Cathedral, Bishop Froilán of León founded both San Salvador de Tábara and San Miguel de Moreruela at the request of King Alfonso III during the late ninth or early tenth century. This would establish institutional connections that might explain Maius’s work for a St. Michael monastery while residing at Tábara. However, the architectural grandeur of San Miguel de Escalada and its documented Mozarabic connections make it a more plausible candidate for a commission of such magnificence. The manuscript’s subsequent provenance history supports the Escalada identification, as the book later belonged to that monastery before being bequeathed to the Orden Militar de Santiago de Uclés in 1566. The Escalada association also fits well with the broader pattern of Mozarabic cultural networking in tenth-century León. Whether Victor held office as abbot throughout Maius’s work on the manuscript, or whether the commission spanned multiple abbacies, cannot be determined from surviving sources. The typical duration of abbatial tenure during this period varied considerably depending on local circumstances. Monastic leaders in frontier regions of Christian Iberia often faced challenges related to security, resources, and ecclesiastical politics that could affect their terms of office.</p>

<p>Beyond Abbot Victor, the question of whether Maius received commissions from other ecclesiastical patrons must be addressed, though the evidence remains limited and somewhat conjectural. The Beatus of Tábara, on which Maius was working at the time of his death in 968, appears to have been commissioned for use within the Tábara monastery itself rather than for an external patron. This manuscript, now largely lost except for fragments preserved in the Archivo Histórico Nacional in Madrid, was completed by Maius’s pupil Emeterius and represents a different type of patronage relationship—one internal to the artist’s own monastic community. The circumstances surrounding this commission are poorly documented, but it likely reflects the desire of Tábara’s monastic leadership to possess its own illustrated Beatus commentary. Whether this project was initiated before or after the Morgan Beatus cannot be determined with certainty, though the fact that Maius was still working on it at his death suggests it may have been a later undertaking. The involvement of multiple scribes in the Tábara Beatus—Emeterius, Senior, and Monnius are all named in addition to Maius—suggests a collaborative workshop model that may have functioned differently from the apparently individual production of the Morgan manuscript. The patronage dynamics within one’s own monastery would have differed significantly from those involving external commissions, with less formal negotiation but perhaps more direct oversight. The abbot of Tábara during the 960s would have been Maius’s immediate superior and would have allocated resources and assigned priorities for the scriptorium’s work.</p>

<p>The broader ecclesiastical networks of tenth-century León provide context for understanding the possible range of Maius’s patronage relationships. The region was experiencing significant monastic reform and expansion under royal patronage during this period, with connections between religious houses facilitating the circulation of texts, artistic models, and skilled artisans. King Alfonso III and his successors actively supported monastic foundations as part of the Christian reconquest and resettlement of territories recovered from Muslim control. Monasteries served not only religious functions but also political and cultural roles in consolidating Christian authority in frontier regions. Elite ecclesiastical patrons in this context valued manuscripts both as religious texts and as statements of institutional prestige and cultural sophistication. The production of Beatus manuscripts, with their elaborate illumination cycles, represented a particularly Iberian tradition that connected contemporary institutions to the heritage of eighth-century Liébana. Whether Maius received royal patronage or commissions from episcopal authorities cannot be determined from surviving sources, but the quality of his work would certainly have attracted attention beyond his immediate monastic circle. The fact that his student Emeterius praised him as “archipictor” suggests that his reputation extended beyond Tábara. Some scholars have speculated that connections to the royal court at León may have existed, given the proximity of Escalada to the capital and the monastery’s rich architectural decoration. However, such connections remain hypothetical in the absence of documentary evidence. The pattern of Beatus manuscript production in tenth and eleventh-century León shows various forms of patronage, from abbatial commissions to royal sponsorship, but Maius’s specific involvement beyond the documented Victor commission and the Tábara project cannot be established with certainty.</p>

<h2 id="artistic-style-and-technical-innovation">Artistic Style and Technical Innovation</h2>

<p>Maius’s artistic style represents a watershed moment in the development of Beatus manuscript illumination, introducing innovations that would influence subsequent generations of Iberian illuminators. His approach to manuscript decoration is characterized by a bold use of color, with a palette dominated by intense primary hues, particularly a striking blue that often mixes with red to create rich purple tones. This chromatic intensity distinguishes his work from earlier Beatus manuscripts and reflects technical innovations in pigment preparation and application. According to scholarly analysis, Maius revolutionized the painting techniques used in Beatus production by substituting traditional water-based paints with colors bound using new media including egg, honey, and glue. These binding agents were applied over backgrounds that were often burnished with wax, creating a surface that transformed the appearance of natural pigments through glazing effects. This technical approach produced greater chromatic harmony through subtle color modeling and enhanced the overall quality of the illuminations significantly. The result was a more luminous and visually striking surface than earlier manuscripts had achieved. Maius’s technical innovations also improved the durability and preservation of the pigments, as evidenced by the remarkable color retention in the Morgan Beatus after more than a millennium. His trademark stylistic feature involved painting drapery in multiple contrasting colors, creating visual dynamism and decorative richness. This polychrome approach to fabric representation became a hallmark of his work and was adopted by his students and followers.</p>

<p>The spatial organization of Maius’s illuminations represents another significant innovation in Beatus manuscript design. He modified the compositional strategies employed in earlier manuscripts, introducing miniatures that occupy double-page spreads, a feature rare in previous illustrated versions of the text. This expansion of the pictorial field allowed for more elaborate compositions and more dramatic visual impact when the manuscript was opened. Maius organized his pictorial space in horizontal bands of irregular thickness, creating a distinctive visual rhythm across the page. His figures lack conventional perspective and three-dimensional modeling, rendered instead in an essentially flat, two-dimensional manner. This artistic choice was not the result of technical limitation but rather reflected a deliberate aesthetic approach suited to the manuscript’s spiritual purpose. By eschewing naturalistic representation, Maius created what might be termed a surrealistic religious environment that emphasized the otherworldly nature of apocalyptic visions. The flattened pictorial space and abstract spatial relationships serve to remove the imagery from mundane reality and locate it in a transcendent spiritual realm. This approach proved remarkably effective for visualizing the bizarre and terrifying visions described in the Book of Revelation. The decorative borders and frames that Maius introduced represent another innovation, providing structure and definition to his compositions while adding layers of ornamental richness. These frames often feature geometric patterns and vegetal motifs drawn from both Christian and Islamic artistic vocabularies, reflecting the multicultural environment of medieval Iberia.</p>

<p>Maius’s iconographic contributions extended beyond technical and compositional innovations to include new subjects and interpretations within the Beatus tradition. He introduced prefatory portraits of the Evangelists to the Beatus manuscript format, images not present in earlier versions of the text. These author portraits connect the Beatus commentary to the broader tradition of Gospel book illumination and emphasize the textual authority underlying the apocalyptic interpretation. Maius also developed elaborate illustrated genealogical tables tracing Christ’s ancestry, creating complex visual diagrams that combine text and image in innovative ways. His depiction of Noah’s Ark as a multi-story structure represents another iconographic innovation that would be followed in later manuscripts. The cycle of miniatures illustrating Jerome’s Commentary on Daniel, included as a supplementary text in the Morgan Beatus, showcases Maius’s ability to develop appropriate visual programs for different textual materials. His representations of the Seven Churches of Asia, the Lamb surrounded by angels and elders, the Woman Clothed with the Sun, and other apocalyptic visions establish iconographic conventions that subsequent illuminators would follow. The way Maius balanced adherence to textual description with creative visual interpretation demonstrates sophisticated understanding of both the theological content and the communicative possibilities of images. His compositions often include architectural elements featuring horseshoe arches derived from Islamic building traditions, situating the apocalyptic narrative in a recognizably Iberian visual context.</p>

<p>The figure style that characterizes Maius’s work combines expressive gesture with decorative surface treatment, creating images that are both emotionally engaging and formally sophisticated. His human figures feature large, emphatic eyes that create direct connection with viewers, conveying the intensity of apocalyptic revelation. Bodies are rendered as relatively simple forms defined by strong outlines and filled with flat color, with drapery providing the primary vehicle for decorative elaboration. The faces often display a frontal, hieratic quality that emphasizes the sacred nature of the depicted figures, though Maius occasionally employs profile views for variety and to indicate interaction between characters. Angels in his compositions are distinguished by their wings and haloes but otherwise share the formal vocabulary of human figures. The beasts and monsters that populate the apocalypse receive particularly inventive treatment, with Maius creating visual equivalents for the fantastic creatures described in the text. His seven-headed dragon, multi-eyed beasts, and hybrid creatures combine zoomorphic elements in ways that are both terrifying and visually compelling. The attention to decorative detail in these creatures—scales, feathers, claws—demonstrates Maius’s observational skills and his ability to translate natural forms into stylized patterns. Animal forms drawn from the natural world, including horses, birds, and fish, appear in his work with a similar combination of recognizability and decorative stylization. The overall effect is a visual language that operates between representation and abstraction, suitable for depicting both earthly and supernatural realms.</p>

<p>Color symbolism plays an important role in Maius’s artistic program, though the specific symbolic meanings of his color choices must be inferred from both textual traditions and comparative analysis. The prominent use of red in his work may carry associations with blood, sacrifice, and martyrdom, themes central to apocalyptic theology. Blue and purple, colors traditionally associated with royalty and divinity, appear frequently in depicting Christ, angels, and heavenly realms. Gold and silver, though used sparingly in the Morgan Beatus and primarily in the early folios, carry obvious associations with preciousness and divine light. The contrast between light and dark passages in his compositions may reflect the theological dualism of the apocalyptic narrative, with its clear demarcation between good and evil, salvation and damnation. White backgrounds in some miniatures create a sense of spiritual purity or void, while darker grounds suggest earthly or infernal realms. The juxtaposition of vivid, contrasting colors creates visual tension that mirrors the theological tensions in the text. Modern technical analysis of Maius’s pigments has revealed the use of various mineral and organic colorants including cinnabar, azurite, malachite, and organic reds and yellows, demonstrating access to a sophisticated palette. The careful gradation and mixing of colors in some passages shows considerable technical skill in pigment preparation and application. The overall chromatic effect of his work—vibrant, intense, and sometimes jarring in its color contrasts—creates an appropriate visual equivalent for the violent and dramatic events of the apocalypse.</p>

<h2 id="artistic-influences-and-cultural-context">Artistic Influences and Cultural Context</h2>

<p>The artistic formation of Maius must be understood within the complex cultural environment of tenth-century Iberia, where Christian, Islamic, and classical traditions intersected and influenced one another. If the tradition identifying his origins in Córdoba is accurate, Maius would have been exposed during his formative years to the sophisticated visual culture of Al-Andalus, then at the height of its artistic achievement under the Umayyad Caliphate. The Great Mosque of Córdoba, expanded during the tenth century, exemplified the architectural and decorative arts of Islamic Iberia, featuring the characteristic horseshoe arches, complex geometric patterns, and rich surface decoration that would appear in transformed fashion in Maius’s work. Mozarabic Christians in Córdoba maintained their religious identity while necessarily engaging with the dominant Islamic culture, creating a hybrid artistic tradition that synthesized elements from multiple sources. The visual vocabulary of Mozarabic art, which characterizes Maius’s style, drew upon late antique and Visigothic Christian traditions while incorporating decorative motifs and formal approaches from Islamic art. This cultural synthesis was not superficial borrowing but rather reflected the lived experience of communities navigating multiple cultural systems. The manuscript illumination traditions that Maius inherited included both indigenous Iberian practices and influences from manuscript production in other regions of medieval Europe. Connections between Iberian scriptoria and those in Carolingian territories, Italy, and North Africa facilitated the circulation of artistic models and technical knowledge.</p>

<p>The immediate artistic tradition within which Maius worked was the established convention of Beatus manuscript illustration, which had developed over the previous century and a half. Beatus of Liébana completed his Commentary on the Apocalypse around 776, and manuscripts of this text began to be illustrated probably within a generation of its composition. The earliest illustrated Beatus manuscripts, now lost, established iconographic conventions and compositional formats that subsequent illuminators both followed and modified. Maius would have had access to at least one earlier illustrated Beatus manuscript that served as his model, though this exemplar has not survived. Scholars have identified stylistic and iconographic features in the Morgan Beatus that reflect earlier phases of the Beatus tradition, demonstrating Maius’s knowledge of precedents. However, Maius did not simply copy his model but rather transformed it through his technical and compositional innovations. His approach represents what scholars have identified as the beginning of the second major stylistic phase in Beatus manuscript production. The first phase, represented by manuscripts now lost or surviving only in fragments, apparently featured a different approach to color, composition, and iconographic detail. Maius’s innovations established conventions that would be followed by illuminators working at Tábara and other scriptoria in the later tenth and early eleventh centuries. His student Emeterius continued his master’s stylistic approach in the completion of the Tábara Beatus and in collaboration with the illuminator Ende on the Girona Beatus. The painter Senior, who also worked at Tábara, shows knowledge of Maius’s innovations in the Urgell Beatus.</p>

<p>The question of specific artistic influences beyond the Beatus tradition must be approached with caution, as direct documentary evidence is lacking. However, comparative stylistic analysis suggests possible connections to other artistic currents. The decorative vocabulary of the Morgan Beatus shares certain features with Andalusian textiles, ivory carvings, and metalwork of the tenth century, suggesting that Maius had access to objects produced in Islamic workshops or had trained his eye on such works. The interlace patterns, vegetal scrolls, and geometric motifs that appear in his border decorations and framing elements find parallels in the decorative arts of Al-Andalus. The use of horseshoe arches in architectural representations clearly derives from Islamic building traditions visible throughout Iberia. Some scholars have noted similarities between certain figure types in Maius’s work and those in early Christian manuscripts from North Africa and the eastern Mediterranean, suggesting possible connections to late antique painting traditions that survived in Mozarabic culture. The expressive, large-eyed faces in Maius’s figures recall conventions of Coptic Christian art from Egypt, though whether this represents direct influence or parallel development within Christian communities under Islamic rule remains debatable. The compositional approach of organizing images in horizontal registers finds precedents in various artistic traditions including early Christian narrative art and Islamic manuscript illustration. The anti-naturalistic spatial organization and flat figure style that characterize Maius’s work connect to broader tendencies in early medieval art throughout Europe, where symbolic and spiritual significance took precedence over naturalistic representation.</p>

<p>Liturgical and theological currents in tenth-century Iberian Christianity also shaped Maius’s artistic choices. The Beatus commentary itself represents a particular interpretative tradition regarding the Book of Revelation, emphasizing themes of judgment, spiritual warfare, and the ultimate triumph of Christianity over its enemies. In the context of Christian kingdoms engaged in territorial conflict with Al-Andalus, these themes carried obvious contemporary resonance. Maius’s powerful visualizations of apocalyptic beasts, battles, and divine judgment would have spoken to audiences living in what they understood as spiritually contested territory. The Mozarabic liturgy preserved by Christian communities in Iberia featured distinctive traditions that differed from Roman usage, and these liturgical practices may have influenced how illuminators approached visual representation of sacred subjects. The theological emphasis on spiritual vision and mystical experience that pervades the Beatus commentary finds visual equivalent in Maius’s otherworldly aesthetic. His artistic choices serve not to represent ordinary reality but to evoke visionary experience, creating images that function as windows into transcendent realms. This theological function of images would have been clearly understood within monastic contexts where manuscripts were used for liturgical reading, private meditation, and instruction. The influence of contemporary theological debates and interpretative traditions on Maius’s specific iconographic choices cannot be precisely traced but must be assumed as background to his work.</p>

<p>The role of workshop traditions and collaborative artistic practice in shaping Maius’s style must also be considered. The scriptorium at San Salvador de Tábara, where Maius worked, represented an institutional context with its own practices, standards, and accumulated knowledge. The training that Maius received, presumably at Tábara or possibly earlier at another institution, would have transmitted technical skills, artistic conventions, and perhaps specific compositional models. The presence of multiple named scribes and illuminators at Tábara indicates a workshop environment where skills and knowledge were shared. Maius’s role as teacher to Emeterius, Ende, and possibly others demonstrates his position within a lineage of artistic transmission. The ways in which his students both preserved and modified his approach illuminate the dynamics of influence and innovation within workshop traditions. The fragmentary nature of the historical record makes it impossible to identify with certainty the master from whom Maius himself learned, though such a relationship must have existed. Some scholars have speculated about connections to illuminators working in other Iberian scriptoria during the early tenth century, but these remain conjectural. The general patterns of artistic influence in medieval contexts operated through multiple channels: direct master-apprentice relationships, the circulation of model books and exemplars, the movement of artists between institutions, and the exchange of finished manuscripts that could serve as models. Maius appears to have been receptive to diverse influences while maintaining a strong individual artistic vision that transformed received traditions into something distinctive and innovative. His achievement lies not in faithful adherence to precedents but in creative synthesis and transformation of various artistic inheritances into a unified and powerful visual language.</p>

<h2 id="travels-and-geographical-mobility">Travels and Geographical Mobility</h2>

<p>The question of Maius’s travels and geographical mobility must be approached with caution, as direct documentary evidence is extremely limited. If the tradition of his Cordoban origin is accurate, his relocation from Andalusia to the kingdom of León represents the most significant documented journey of his life. The distance from Córdoba to the region of Tábara and León spans approximately 400 kilometers through territories that in the tenth century represented contested frontier zones between Christian and Islamic polities. Such a journey would have been undertaken for religious or political reasons, as part of the broader pattern of Mozarabic Christian migration from Al-Andalus to northern Christian kingdoms. The proposed date of 926 for his arrival in León would situate this migration in the context of increasing pressure on Christian communities in Córdoba and active policies by the Leonese monarchy to encourage resettlement of recovered territories. The journey itself would have been arduous and potentially dangerous, requiring passage through military frontier zones and possibly necessitating travel in the company of other migrants or under some form of armed protection. The routes connecting Córdoba to León would have followed ancient Roman roads that remained the primary thoroughfares of medieval Iberia, passing through intermediate towns and monasteries that could provide hospitality to travelers. The decision to undertake such a migration implies either personal religious conviction, family circumstances, or institutional sponsorship. Whether Maius traveled alone or as part of a group of Mozarabic monks relocating to the north cannot be determined from surviving sources.</p>

<p>Once established in the León region, the extent of Maius’s subsequent travels remains largely a matter of inference from his artistic production. The fact that he created the Morgan Beatus for Abbot Victor of San Miguel de Escalada while apparently remaining based at San Salvador de Tábara indicates some form of movement or contact between these institutions. The distance between Tábara and Escalada is approximately 100 kilometers, representing perhaps three to four days’ journey on foot through the Leonese countryside. Whether Maius physically traveled to Escalada to consult with his patron about the manuscript’s program, or whether all negotiations and delivery were handled through intermediaries, cannot be determined. Medieval monastic practice included various arrangements for such inter-institutional collaborations, and the specific logistics of Maius’s work for external patrons remain undocumented. Some scholars have suggested that he may have traveled to Escalada to study architectural details and local artistic works that might inform his illuminations, but this remains speculative. The presence of multiple monasteries within relatively close proximity in the León region—including Tábara, Escalada, Moreruela, and others—created a network of religious houses that maintained regular communication and exchange. Monks might travel between these institutions for various purposes including delivering letters, transporting goods, attending ecclesiastical meetings, or seeking specialized services. As a skilled illuminator whose work was evidently valued beyond his home monastery, Maius may have traveled more frequently than ordinary monks whose lives were defined by monastic stability.</p>

<p>The question of whether Maius traveled to other artistic centers to study manuscripts or artistic works that might have influenced his style invites speculation but lacks documentary support. The monastery of Santo Domingo de Silos, located east of Tábara, emerged as an important artistic center during the eleventh century and may have had earlier significance, but evidence of Maius’s contact with this institution is absent. The possibility that Maius visited León, the capital city of the kingdom and seat of the bishop, seems plausible given the proximity of this important ecclesiastical and political center to his sphere of activity. The cathedral of León housed significant artistic treasures and served as a hub for ecclesiastical networks that connected various monasteries and churches of the region. Whether Maius had occasion to see manuscripts or other artworks in the cathedral treasury, or to meet with ecclesiastical officials there, remains unknown. Some art historians have suggested that certain features of his work reflect knowledge of artistic traditions that might have been transmitted through objects or exemplars in León. The royal court at León, under various rulers of the tenth century, attracted artists and craftsmen and commissioned significant artistic projects. Whether Maius had any direct contact with royal patronage or court culture cannot be confirmed, though the quality of his work would certainly have been known to the kingdom’s elite. The circulation of luxury objects including textiles, ivories, and metalwork from Córdoba and other Islamic centers northward into Christian territories created opportunities for artists to study sophisticated decorative arts.</p>

<p>Pilgrimage routes represented another potential vector for artistic influence and travel during this period. The cult of Saint James at Santiago de Compostela was beginning to develop into a major pilgrimage destination during the tenth century, and routes connecting León with Santiago would have passed through regions near Tábara. Whether Maius undertook pilgrimage to Santiago or other shrines, either as a personal devotion or as part of monastic obligation, remains undocumented. However, the movement of pilgrims created networks of communication and cultural exchange that facilitated the spread of artistic ideas. Monks from various regions sometimes traveled to distant monasteries to study particular texts, obtain copies of manuscripts, or consult with respected teachers. The reputation of certain monastic scriptoria for excellence in particular types of book production could attract visiting scholars or scribes. Whether Tábara itself attracted such visitors during Maius’s tenure, or whether he traveled to other scriptoria to study their methods, cannot be determined from surviving evidence. The general pattern of artistic influence in medieval manuscript production suggests that illuminators learned from exemplars—existing manuscripts that could be studied and copied—rather than primarily through direct personal instruction from masters in distant locations. Nevertheless, the possibility of limited travel for artistic purposes cannot be excluded. The fact that Maius’s innovations influenced subsequent illuminators at other scriptoria beyond Tábara indicates that his work circulated and became known in other centers, whether through the movement of finished manuscripts or through artists who had studied his methods.</p>

<p>The question of whether Maius traveled outside the kingdoms of León and Castile to other regions of Christian Europe must be addressed as essentially speculative. No evidence suggests journeys to Carolingian or post-Carolingian territories in what is now France and Germany, though some scholars have proposed that certain features of Beatus iconography may reflect knowledge of manuscript traditions from these regions. The possibility of travel to Christian kingdoms in northern Iberia—Navarre, Aragón, or the Catalan counties—likewise lacks documentation but cannot be entirely excluded. The political and military circumstances of tenth-century Iberia, with ongoing conflicts between Christian and Islamic polities and among Christian kingdoms themselves, would have rendered long-distance travel difficult and potentially dangerous. Monastic stability, one of the fundamental principles of Benedictine monasticism, would have discouraged extensive travel except for specific purposes approved by ecclesiastical authorities. The vow of stability bound monks to particular communities and limited their freedom of movement. That Maius died and was buried at Tábara in 968 suggests that this monastery remained his primary institutional affiliation throughout his mature career. The extent to which he may have traveled during his earlier years, between his proposed departure from Córdoba around 926 and his documented presence at Tábara in the 940s through 960s, remains a matter of conjecture. The formative experiences and artistic training that prepared him for his mature work as an illuminator must have occurred during these undocumented years, but whether this involved travel to multiple institutions or intensive training at a single location cannot be determined. The geographical scope of Maius’s life, insofar as it can be reconstructed, appears to have been largely confined to the León region during his documented artistic career, though the journey from Córdoba that brought him to this region represents a significant displacement that would have exposed him to diverse landscapes, communities, and cultural influences.</p>

<h2 id="death-and-legacy">Death and Legacy</h2>

<p>Maius died on October 30, 968, at the monastery of San Salvador de Tábara, where he was subsequently buried. The precise cause of his death is not recorded in surviving sources, though the date is preserved through the testimony of his pupil Emeterius, who noted it in the colophon of the Beatus of Tábara. The record indicates that Maius was actively working on this manuscript at the time of his death, suggesting that illness or physical decline did not entirely prevent him from continuing his artistic work. Whether his death came suddenly or after a period of declining health cannot be determined from the available evidence. The medieval monastic context would have provided spiritual preparation for death through the Last Rites and community prayers, and Maius’s burial within the monastery grounds reflects standard practice for professed monks. The location of his grave within the monastery complex is not precisely documented in surviving sources, and later destructions and reconstructions of the building have likely obscured any physical traces. The monastery of San Salvador de Tábara itself was reportedly destroyed during the incursions of the Umayyad general Almanzor around 988, only two decades after Maius’s death. This destruction resulted in the loss of the scriptorium where Maius had worked, though the famous depiction of the Tábara tower scriptorium preserved in the Beatus manuscript completed by Emeterius provides a visual record of this now-lost architectural space. The fact that Emeterius specifically commemorated the date of Maius’s death demonstrates the high regard in which the master was held by his students and the community.</p>

<p>The tribute that Emeterius paid to Maius in the colophon of the Tábara Beatus provides rare personal testimony regarding the illuminator’s reputation and character. Emeterius referred to his master as “archipictor,” a Latin term meaning “master painter” or “chief artist,” indicating Maius’s preeminent status within the artistic community. This honorific designation suggests that Maius was recognized not merely as a competent craftsman but as an artist of exceptional skill and authority whose judgment and approach commanded respect. The relationship between master and pupil in medieval artistic contexts involved not only technical training but also the transmission of aesthetic principles and professional standards. That Emeterius felt moved to commemorate his teacher’s death and praise his abilities suggests a relationship of genuine respect and perhaps affection. The care with which Emeterius completed the Beatus manuscript that Maius had left unfinished demonstrates a commitment to honoring his master’s work. Later sources from the Spanish archival tradition have characterized Maius’s significance by comparing him to a “Picasso of the tenth century,” a modern analogy that, while anachronistic, attempts to convey his revolutionary impact on the artistic conventions of his time. This comparison emphasizes the innovative nature of his contributions and his influence on subsequent artistic developments. Whether such acclaim was widely recognized during his lifetime or primarily emerged through later appreciation of his work cannot be determined with certainty.</p>

<p>The artistic legacy of Maius manifested most directly through the work of his students and the continued influence of his style in subsequent Beatus manuscript production. Emeterius, his principal student, completed the unfinished Tábara Beatus and went on to collaborate with the illuminator Ende on the Girona Beatus, produced probably in the 970s. These manuscripts demonstrate clear continuation of Maius’s technical innovations and stylistic approaches, particularly in the use of binding media for pigments, the polychrome treatment of drapery, and the organization of pictorial space. Ende, who worked with Emeterius on the Girona Beatus, is identified in that manuscript’s colophon as a “pintrix” or female painter, representing a rare documented instance of a woman illuminator in medieval Iberia. Whether Ende received direct training from Maius or learned his methods through Emeterius cannot be determined, but her work clearly reflects the master’s influence. The painter Senior, who is mentioned alongside Emeterius in the Tábara scriptorium and who illuminated the Urgell Beatus, likewise shows knowledge of Maius’s innovations. The painter Oveco, who created the Valcavado Beatus in the early eleventh century, represents a later generation that continued to work within the stylistic tradition established by Maius. The fact that the distinctive features of Maius’s approach—his color palette, his compositional strategies, his iconographic innovations—were adopted and adapted by these subsequent illuminators demonstrates his profound impact on the development of Beatus manuscript illustration during the later tenth and early eleventh centuries.</p>

<p>The Morgan Beatus itself, as Maius’s most complete surviving work, has had a significant afterlife beyond its medieval context. After its creation for San Miguel de Escalada in the mid-tenth century, the manuscript remained at that monastery for centuries, serving its intended liturgical and devotional functions. In 1566, the Archbishop of Valencia, Martín Pérez de Ayala, bequeathed the manuscript to the Orden Militar de Santiago de Uclés, removing it from Escalada. The manuscript subsequently entered various private collections during the nineteenth century, passing through the hands of Roberto Frasinelli, Francisque Michel, Guglielmo Libri, and the Earl of Ashburnham before being purchased by Henry Yates Thompson. In 1919, the renowned librarian Belle da Costa Greene acquired the manuscript for J.P. Morgan, bringing it to the United States where it has since been housed at the Morgan Library \&amp; Museum in New York. This provenance history reflects the increasing recognition of the manuscript’s artistic and historical significance during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Modern scholars have extensively studied the Morgan Beatus, producing facsimile editions, iconographic analyses, and technical examinations that have deepened understanding of Maius’s achievement. The manuscript has been the subject of exhibitions and publications that have made its images accessible to audiences far beyond medieval monastic contexts. Art historians have recognized Maius as a pivotal figure in the development of medieval Spanish illumination, and his work is regularly discussed in surveys of medieval art and specialized studies of manuscript illumination. The Morgan Beatus stands at the beginning of a tradition of lavishly illustrated Beatus manuscripts that continued for several centuries, making Maius’s work foundational to this important tradition of Iberian art.</p>

<p>The broader significance of Maius’s achievement lies in his synthesis of diverse cultural influences into a distinctive artistic vision that gave visual form to one of medieval Christianity’s most important apocalyptic texts. His work exemplifies the creative possibilities that emerged from the multicultural environment of tenth-century Iberia, where Christian, Islamic, and classical traditions intersected. The Mozarabic artistic tradition that Maius represents has been recognized as a unique phenomenon in medieval European art, reflecting the particular historical circumstances of Christian communities in the Iberian Peninsula. Modern scholarship has increasingly appreciated the sophistication of Mozarabic art and its contributions to the broader development of medieval visual culture. Maius’s technical innovations in pigment binding and application demonstrate empirical experimentation and problem-solving that advanced the craft of manuscript illumination. His compositional strategies and iconographic inventions provided models that subsequent generations of illuminators would follow and adapt. The emotional intensity and visual power of his apocalyptic imagery continues to impress modern viewers, testifying to the enduring effectiveness of his artistic choices. While many medieval artists remain anonymous, Maius is fortunate to have his name preserved through colophons, allowing modern scholars to attribute specific works to his hand and to trace his influence. This documentation, though limited, provides invaluable evidence for understanding artistic practice and workshop organization in tenth-century Spanish scriptoria. The survival of the Morgan Beatus in excellent condition, with its colors still vibrant after more than a millennium, stands as testament to the quality of Maius’s technical execution. Though he could not have foreseen it, his work would be studied and admired by audiences many centuries after his death, his images continuing to communicate the power and terror of apocalyptic vision to viewers in radically different cultural contexts from his own.</p>

<h2 id="major-works-and-their-current-locations">Major Works and Their Current Locations</h2>

<h3 id="the-morgan-beatus-ms-m644">The Morgan Beatus (MS M.644)</h3>

<p>The Morgan Beatus, also known as the Beatus of San Miguel de Escalada, represents Maius’s most important and complete surviving work, now housed at the Morgan Library \&amp; Museum in New York. This manuscript was executed around 945 at the scriptorium of San Salvador de Tábara at the commission of Abbot Victor for the monastery of St. Michael, generally identified as San Miguel de Escalada. The manuscript comprises 300 folios of fine-quality vellum, measuring approximately 385 x 280 millimeters, organized in two bound volumes for preservation purposes. According to the colophon on folio 293, Maius served as both scribe and illuminator for the entire work, representing a remarkable feat of individual artistic production. The manuscript contains several distinct textual components that together create a comprehensive theological compendium centered on eschatological themes. The primary text is the Commentary on the Apocalypse composed by Beatus of Liébana, a monk from northern Spain who completed this influential interpretation of the Book of Revelation around 776. Beatus’s twelve-book commentary provided a framework for understanding John’s apocalyptic visions, drawing on patristic authorities and offering detailed exegesis of the biblical text. Maius’s copy of this text occupies folios 1 through 233, accompanied by an extensive cycle of illustrations that visualize the apocalyptic narrative and its interpretation.</p>

<p>The illumination program of the Morgan Beatus includes 110 miniatures of varying sizes and formats, representing one of the most extensive pictorial cycles in any Beatus manuscript. Among these are 68 full-page miniatures that devote entire folios to single compositions, allowing Maius to develop complex apocalyptic scenes with multiple figures and dramatic spatial arrangements. An additional 48 smaller miniatures are integrated within the text columns or occupy portions of pages, providing visual commentary on specific passages. The manuscript also contains numerous diagrams, colored initials, and ornamental elements that enhance the visual richness of the codex. Maius introduced several iconographic innovations that distinguish the Morgan Beatus from earlier manuscripts in the tradition. The prefatory material includes a series of Evangelist portraits on folios 1v through 4r, depicting Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John with their traditional symbols. These author portraits, not present in earlier Beatus manuscripts, connect the apocalyptic commentary to the Gospel tradition and establish the textual authority underlying the work. Folios 4v through 9v contain elaborate illustrated genealogical tables tracing Christ’s ancestry, visual diagrams that combine text and decorative elements in complex layouts. These genealogies emphasize Christ’s historical incarnation within human lineage while situating the apocalyptic events within salvation history. The cycle of apocalyptic illustrations proper begins with folio 10 and continues through the main body of the text, depicting the sequential visions described in Revelation: the letters to the Seven Churches of Asia, the heavenly throne room with the Lamb and the twenty-four elders, the opening of the seven seals, the seven trumpets, the Woman Clothed with the Sun pursued by the dragon, the beasts from sea and earth, the vintage of wrath, the Whore of Babylon, the defeat of the dragon, the Last Judgment, and the Heavenly Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Maius’s treatment of these apocalyptic themes demonstrates his ability to translate complex textual descriptions into powerful visual forms. The depiction of the Lamb surrounded by the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders, a central image in apocalyptic iconography, shows Maius’s characteristic use of brilliant color and formal arrangement. The Lamb stands at the center of a mandorla while the elders, arranged in registers, hold their crowns and musical instruments as described in the biblical text. The four living creatures—the man, lion, ox, and eagle representing the Evangelists—occupy the corners of the composition in accordance with traditional iconography. Maius’s rendering emphasizes flat, decorative patterns rather than naturalistic space, creating an otherworldly vision appropriate to the supernatural content. The horsemen of the Apocalypse appear in dynamic compositions that convey movement through gesture and arrangement rather than through naturalistic representation of space. The dragon with seven heads and ten horns, described in Revelation 12, receives elaborate visual treatment that transforms the textual description into a memorable image of terrifying power. Each head features distinctive characteristics, and the arrangement of the creature suggests careful attention to the textual source while exercising creative interpretation in the visual realization. The Woman Clothed with the Sun, pursued by the dragon, receives treatment that emphasizes both her dignity and her vulnerability, with brilliant colors distinguishing her celestial nature. The architectural representations throughout the manuscript feature horseshoe arches derived from Islamic building traditions, particularly those of Córdoba, creating a recognizably Iberian visual context for the apocalyptic narrative. These architectural elements demonstrate Maius’s knowledge of Andalusian art and his integration of contemporary visual vocabularies into the apocalyptic imagery. The depiction of Belshazzar’s Feast in Jerome’s Commentary on Daniel showcases an elaborate horseshoe arch with alternating red and white voussoirs, a specifically Cordoban motif that situates the biblical narrative within a familiar architectural vocabulary.</p>

<p>The manuscript’s supplementary texts receive appropriate illustrative treatment that demonstrates Maius’s versatility beyond the apocalyptic cycle. The Commentary on Daniel by St. Jerome occupies folios 238v through 292v and includes its own series of miniatures depicting key episodes from Daniel’s prophetic book. These illustrations show the same technical mastery and stylistic approach as the apocalyptic miniatures but adapt to different narrative requirements. The vision of the four beasts, Nebuchadnezzar’s dream of the statue, Daniel in the lions’ den, and other prophetic visions receive visual interpretation that makes them accessible to monastic readers. The genealogical tables that trace Christ’s ancestry from Adam through the patriarchs and kings of Israel represent a particularly innovative contribution, creating complex visual diagrams that combine text and decorative elements and the arrangement of these heads displays Maius’s skill in creating coherent compositions from fantastical textual descriptions. The Woman Clothed with the Sun pursued by the dragon represents one of the manuscript’s most striking images, with the female figure rendered in brilliant colors that emphasize her celestial nature while the seven-headed dragon threatens from below. The architectural settings throughout the manuscript feature horseshoe arches in the Islamic style, particularly those characteristic of Córdoba, creating visual connections to contemporary Iberian architecture. These architectural elements situate the apocalyptic narrative within a recognizably Mozarabic visual context, demonstrating how Maius synthesized Christian iconographic traditions with formal vocabularies drawn from Islamic art.</p>

<p>The manuscript includes supplementary texts beyond the Beatus commentary that receive appropriate illustrative programs demonstrating Maius’s versatility. St. Jerome’s Commentary on Daniel occupies folios 238v through 292v and includes miniatures depicting key prophetic episodes including the vision of the four beasts, Nebuchadnezzar’s dream, and Daniel in the lions’ den. The depiction of Belshazzar’s Feast showcases an elaborate horseshoe arch with alternating red and white voussoirs, a specifically Cordoban architectural motif that demonstrates Maius’s knowledge of Andalusian design. The genealogical tables tracing Christ’s ancestry represent innovative visual diagrams combining text and decoration in complex layouts that emphasize salvation history. These tables occupy folios 4v through 9v and show Maius’s ability to create sophisticated visual programs for different types of textual material beyond narrative illustration. Excerpts from Isidore of Seville’s <em>Etymologiae</em> and other texts round out the manuscript’s contents, creating a comprehensive theological compendium centered on eschatological themes.</p>

<p>The technical execution of the Morgan Beatus demonstrates Maius’s mastery of manuscript production at every level. His calligraphy throughout the 300 folios maintains consistent quality and legibility, with carefully formed Visigothic script that reflects the scribal traditions of tenth-century Spain. The layout of text and image shows sophisticated understanding of page design, with miniatures integrated into the overall visual program in ways that guide readers through the complex theological material. Maius’s innovations in pigment binding—using egg, honey, and glue as media applied over wax-burnished grounds—produced colors of exceptional luminosity and durability. The manuscript’s remarkable state of preservation after more than a millennium testifies to the quality of his materials and technical execution. Modern technical analysis has revealed his sophisticated palette including mineral pigments such as cinnabar, azurite, and malachite, alongside organic colorants. The manuscript represents approximately three to four years of intensive labor by a single artist-scribe, making it an extraordinary achievement of individual artistic production. After its completion around 945, the manuscript served its intended liturgical and devotional functions at San Miguel de Escalada for centuries before entering various private collections and finally being acquired by J.P. Morgan in 1919 through Belle da Costa Greene. It now stands as the centerpiece of the Morgan Library’s medieval manuscript collection and remains available for scholarly study and public exhibition.</p>

<h3 id="the-beatus-of-tábara">The Beatus of Tábara</h3>

<p>The Beatus of Tábara represents Maius’s final, unfinished work, on which he was actively engaged at the time of his death on October 30, 968. This manuscript was being produced for use within the scriptorium of San Salvador de Tábara itself, representing an internal commission rather than work for an external patron. Unlike the Morgan Beatus, which Maius executed entirely himself, the Tábara manuscript involved collaborative production among multiple scribes and illuminators working within the monastery’s scriptorium. The colophon identifies several hands contributing to the work: Maius as the master illuminator, Emeterius as his principal student who would complete the manuscript after the master’s death, and Senior and Monnius as additional scribes. This collaborative model reflects common practice in medieval scriptoria, where major manuscript projects often involved division of labor among specialists. The Beatus of Tábara originally comprised a complete copy of the Commentary on the Apocalypse with an extensive illumination cycle comparable in scope to that of the Morgan manuscript. However, this manuscript suffered severe damage and dismemberment over subsequent centuries, with only fragments surviving to the present day.</p>

<p>The fragmentary remains of the Tábara Beatus are now dispersed among several institutional collections, with the most significant portions preserved in the Archivo Histórico Nacional in Madrid. These surviving folios demonstrate stylistic continuity with Maius’s work on the Morgan Beatus while also showing the contributions of Emeterius and other collaborators. The most famous image from this manuscript is the depiction of the tower scriptorium of Tábara itself, a rare medieval representation of an actual working scriptorium showing the architectural space where manuscripts were produced. This extraordinary image appears on one of the surviving folios and shows a multi-story tower structure with monks working at different levels. At the top of the tower, an illuminator works at a desk while a bell-ringer occupies the uppermost level. The architectural detail of this image, including the horseshoe arches characteristic of Mozarabic construction, provides invaluable documentation of tenth-century Spanish monastic architecture. The scriptorium building depicted in this miniature was reportedly destroyed during the campaigns of Almanzor around 988, making this visual record even more significant as evidence for a lost architectural monument.</p>

<p>The colophon of the Tábara Beatus contains precious biographical information about Maius, including the date of his death and Emeterius’s tribute to his master. In this text, Emeterius refers to Maius as “archipictor,” acknowledging his status as master painter and expressing the respect in which the deceased illuminator was held by his students and community. The colophon also documents the continuation of work on the manuscript after Maius’s death, with Emeterius taking responsibility for completing the illuminations his master had left unfinished. This provides rare insight into workshop practice and the transmission of artistic knowledge from master to apprentice in medieval scriptoria. The portions of the manuscript attributable to Maius himself demonstrate the same technical innovations and stylistic characteristics visible in the Morgan Beatus: vibrant polychrome palette, figures with large expressive eyes, decorative drapery treatment, and anti-naturalistic spatial organization. The illuminations completed by Emeterius after Maius’s death show faithful adherence to the master’s approach, indicating successful transmission of technique and aesthetic principles. Some scholars have attempted to distinguish between Maius’s hand and that of his continuators based on subtle differences in execution, but the fragmentary state of the manuscript and the intentional stylistic continuity make such attributions challenging.</p>

<p>The date of the Tábara Beatus’s initiation remains uncertain, though it must have begun sometime before 968 and was completed by Emeterius probably in the early 970s. Whether this project was undertaken before, during, or after Maius’s work on the Morgan Beatus cannot be definitively established. Some scholars have suggested that the two manuscripts may have been produced concurrently, with Maius dividing his time between the external commission for Escalada and the internal project for his own monastery. Others have proposed a sequential relationship, with the Tábara manuscript begun after completion of the Morgan Beatus. The collaborative nature of the Tábara project, involving multiple scribes and illuminators, contrasts with the apparently individual production of the Morgan manuscript and may reflect different organizational approaches to manuscript making. The destruction and dismemberment of the Tábara Beatus represents a significant loss to our understanding of Maius’s artistic development and workshop practice. Had the manuscript survived intact, it would provide crucial comparative evidence alongside the Morgan Beatus for assessing the illuminator’s style, working methods, and possible evolution over time. The surviving fragments, while precious, cannot adequately represent the original scope and splendor of this lost masterpiece.</p>

<p>Beyond the two securely documented Beatus manuscripts—the Morgan Beatus and the fragmentary Tábara Beatus—questions of attribution and influence become more complex and speculative. No other works can be attributed to Maius with absolute certainty based on documentary evidence comparable to the colophons that identify him in these two manuscripts. However, his influence on subsequent Beatus manuscript production was profound and can be traced through the works of his students and followers. The Girona Beatus, completed around 975 by Emeterius in collaboration with the illuminator Ende, represents the most direct continuation of Maius’s artistic legacy. This manuscript, now preserved in the Cathedral of Girona, demonstrates clear stylistic continuity with Maius’s innovations in color use, compositional strategies, and iconographic conventions. Ende, identified in the manuscript’s colophon as “pintrix” (female painter) and “Dei aiutrix” (helper of God), represents a rare documented instance of a woman illuminator in medieval Spain. Whether she received direct training from Maius or learned his methods through Emeterius cannot be determined, but her work clearly reflects knowledge of the master’s approach.</p>

<p>The Urgell Beatus, illuminated by the painter Senior probably in the late tenth century, likewise shows influence of Maius’s stylistic innovations. Senior is mentioned alongside Emeterius in the Tábara scriptorium, suggesting he may have had direct contact with Maius’s working methods. The Valcavado Beatus, created by the illuminator Oveco in the early eleventh century, represents a later generation continuing to work within the tradition established by Maius. These manuscripts demonstrate how Maius’s technical innovations—particularly his methods of pigment binding and his chromatic approaches—were transmitted and adapted by subsequent generations of Iberian illuminators. The distinctive characteristics of what scholars have identified as the “second phase” of Beatus manuscript illustration derive fundamentally from Maius’s innovations. His influence extended beyond Tábara to other scriptoria in León and Castile, shaping the development of Mozarabic manuscript illumination throughout the later tenth and early eleventh centuries. While individual illuminators adapted his methods to their own artistic personalities and the specific requirements of their commissions, the fundamental vocabulary of Beatus illustration after Maius bears his stamp. His achievement in synthesizing diverse cultural influences—late antique Christian traditions, Islamic decorative arts, and indigenous Iberian practices—into a distinctive and powerful visual language defined the Beatus tradition for generations. The survival of his masterpiece, the Morgan Beatus, ensures that modern audiences can appreciate the full scope of his artistic vision and technical mastery.</p>
