## Historical Significance

Cimabue's importance in art history:
- Transitional figure between Byzantine and Gothic styles
- Teacher of Giotto (according to tradition)
- One of the first artists mentioned by name in historical records
- Helped establish Florence as an artistic center

## Legacy

Cimabue's influence extended through his alleged pupil Giotto and the Florentine school of painting. His work showed that Italian artists were beginning to move beyond Byzantine conventions toward a more naturalistic style.

## Contemporary Recognition

Dante Alighieri mentioned Cimabue in the Purgatorio (Divine Comedy), noting that his fame had been surpassed by his pupil Giotto:
"Cimabue thought to hold the field in painting, and now Giotto has the cry, so that the fame of the former is obscured."

This reference indicates Cimabue's significance in his time and the rapid evolution of art during this period.

## Artistic Innovation

While maintaining Byzantine traditions, Cimabue introduced:
- More naturalistic treatment of drapery
- Greater emotional expression
- Architectural elements with depth
- Softer modeling of faces and figures
- Movement away from rigid, hieratic compositions
