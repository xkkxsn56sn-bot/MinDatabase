## Context and Importance

The Codex Vergilius Romanus, preserved in the Vatican Apostolic Library under the call number Vat. lat. 3867, is one of the oldest and most significant manuscripts of classical literature, dating back to the second half of the 5th century AD. This illuminated codex is a fundamental bridge between late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, embodying the cultural, artistic, and productive transformations of the book that characterized this period of transition. Its importance transcends the boundaries of mere textual preservation, as it documents the evolution of book production techniques and the adaptation of the classical tradition to the new cultural needs of the post-Roman world. The manuscript bears witness to the continuity of the Virgilian tradition in an era of profound political and social transformation, when the Western Roman Empire was giving way to the Roman-Barbarian kingdoms. Its survival through the centuries represents a miracle of preservation that allows us to understand the dynamics of cultural transmission in the late antique world.

The cultural dimension of Vergilius Romanus fits into the broader context of the late antique reception of Virgil, when the work of the Mantuan poet had acquired an almost canonical status in the education and culture of the Roman elites. The fifth century represents a crucial moment for the survival of classical literature, characterized by the emergence of new patrons and the transformation of practices of reading and preserving ancient texts. Virgil's work in this period was no longer just a poetic text, but had acquired symbolic and political significance, representing continuity with Roman greatness even in the most peripheral provinces of the Empire. The decision to produce such a sumptuous codex dedicated to Virgil's works testifies to the persistence of a refined aristocratic culture, capable of investing considerable resources in the preservation and transmission of the classical literary heritage. The manuscript is therefore an exceptional document of the cultural vitality of the fifth century, an era too often considered one of decline and decadence.

The artistic importance of the Vergilius Romanus lies in its nineteen miniatures, which constitute one of the rarest examples of late antique book painting that have survived to this day. These images, created with seven different colors and framed by precious gold leaf gilding, are unique in the evolution of book art, documenting the transition from the classical illustrative tradition to forms of expression that anticipate medieval art. The miniatures in the codex display stylistic characteristics that depart from late imperial Roman naturalism, adopting a more schematic and symbolic rendering of the figures, with particular attention to the narrative and didactic aspects of the scenes depicted. The painting technique used reveals the influence of different artistic traditions, suggesting a culturally composite production environment open to stylistic influences from different areas of the Empire. This iconographic richness makes the Vergilius Romanus a fundamental document for understanding the evolution of European book art.

The historical and political context of the production of the Vergilius Romanus coincides with the decline of the Western Roman Empire and the emergence of new political entities in the imperial provinces. The fifth century was characterized by the fragmentation of Western imperial power and the birth of Roman-Barbarian kingdoms that maintained, at least initially, Roman administrative and cultural structures. In this context, the production of luxurious codices such as the Vergilius Romanus testifies to the persistence of cultural elites capable of keeping classical book traditions alive, despite the profound political transformations underway. The commissioning of such refined works indicates the existence of centers of power and culture that still had sufficient economic resources and technical expertise to support high-level artistic production. The manuscript is therefore a valuable document for understanding the dynamics of cultural continuity in a time of transition, when provincial aristocracies sought to maintain links with Roman tradition through the preservation of the classical literary heritage.

The 5th-century Virgilian manuscript tradition shows particular vitality, as evidenced not only by the Vergilius Romanus, but also by other contemporary codices such as the Vergilius Vaticanus and the Vergilius Augusteus. These manuscripts constitute a homogeneous group of witnesses documenting the existence of scriptoria specializing in the production of luxury Virgilian codices, probably intended for high-level aristocratic patrons. The contemporaneity of these codices suggests a renewed interest in Virgil's work in the 5th century, perhaps linked to the political transformations of the time and the need to reaffirm Roman cultural identity in the face of barbarian pressures. The exceptional quality of these manuscripts indicates the existence of a network of highly specialized book workshops capable of producing works of extraordinary technical and artistic refinement. The Vergilius Romanus is therefore part of a broader panorama of Virgilian cultural renaissance that characterizes the fifth century as one of the most significant moments in the classical manuscript tradition.

The influence of the Vergilius Romanus on subsequent medieval culture is documented by its presence in the Abbey of Saint-Denis from the Middle Ages until the 15th century, a monastic environment that was one of the most important cultural centers of medieval Europe. The presence of the codex in this prestigious monastery testifies to the recognition of its cultural and artistic value by the French ecclesiastical elites, who preserved it for centuries as one of the treasures of their library. The Abbey of Saint-Denis, closely linked to the French royal dynasty and a center of cultural production of the highest order, was an ideal environment for the preservation of such a precious work. The manuscript's long stay in this monastic context ensured its survival through the dark ages of the early Middle Ages, when many other examples of classical literature were lost. The codex is therefore a paradigmatic example of the role played by the great medieval monastic centers in preserving the classical cultural heritage.

The codicological dimension of the Vergilius Romanus reveals fundamental aspects of late antique book production techniques, representing an exceptional document for understanding the evolution of the book from antiquity to the Middle Ages. The codex, with its 309 surviving parchment leaves (out of an estimated original total of about 410 leaves), documents the adoption of the codex form for the preservation of classical literature at a time when papyrus scrolls were still widely used. The choice of parchment as a writing medium indicates the desire to create a work destined to last over time, while the use of rustic capital letters testifies to the persistence of Roman graphic traditions in a chronological context that was already fully late antique. The considerable size of the manuscript (332 x 323 mm) and its textual organization (18 lines per page) reveal layout criteria that would significantly influence subsequent medieval book production. The Vergilius Romanus therefore represents a fundamental link in the evolutionary chain leading from the ancient book to the medieval book.

The philological importance of the Vergilius Romanus derives from its status as a complete witness to Virgil's Aeneid and Georgics, representing a textual source of primary importance for the critical constitution of the Mantuan poet's text. The manuscript preserves significant textual variants that place it in a unique position within the Virgilian manuscript tradition, offering alternative readings that enrich our understanding of the textual history of Virgil's works. Its antiquity and the quality of its textual tradition make it a privileged witness for the reconstruction of the Virgilian archetype, contributing significantly to modern philological studies. The codex also documents the transmission of Virgil's minor works (the Bucolics), offering a complete picture of the reception of Virgil's work in the fifth century. The presence of contemporary glosses and annotations testifies to the active use of the manuscript as a tool for study and reading, providing valuable information on late antique exegetical practices.

The critical fortune of the Vergilius Romanus in modern art history and philology has contributed significantly to the understanding of late antique book art and the transmission of classical culture. David H. Wright's codicological studies represented a methodological turning point in the scientific approach to the manuscript, establishing standards of technical analysis that have influenced the entire discipline of paleography. Erwin Rosenthal's research on the iconographic apparatus of the codex opened up new perspectives for investigating the stylistic evolution of European book art, while Kurt Weitzmann's studies placed the manuscript in the broader context of late antique and early medieval art. The presence of the codex in major international exhibitions dedicated to medieval book art testifies to the recognition of its exceptional value by the international scientific community. The Vergilius Romanus is now a paradigmatic case study for understanding the processes of cultural transformation between antiquity and the Middle Ages.

The contemporary relevance of the Vergilius Romanus is evident in its role as a privileged witness to the processes of cultural transition that characterized 5th-century Europe, offering fundamental insights for understanding the dynamics of transformation in Western civilization. The manuscript documents the ability of late antique cultures to renew themselves while maintaining strong links with the classical tradition, representing a model of cultural adaptation that remains relevant even in the contemporary era. Its survival through fifteen centuries of European history testifies to the strength of Western cultural tradition and its ability to preserve and transmit the fundamental values of classical civilization. Today, the codex is a symbol of European cultural continuity, a document that links classical antiquity to the contemporary world through an unbroken thread of cultural transmission. Its presence in the Vatican collections makes it a heritage of all humanity, a treasure that belongs to world cultural history and continues to offer food for thought and study for future generations.

## Material and Codicology

The codicological structure of the Vergilius Romanus reveals exceptional technical characteristics that testify to the high level of specialization of late antique craftsmen in the processing of parchment and the assembly of codices. The manuscript consists of 309 surviving parchment leaves, carefully prepared according to late antique techniques that involved a long process of maceration, scraping, and smoothing of sheep and cow hides. The quality of the parchment used is exceptional, characterized by a uniform and smooth surface that testifies to the use of selected hides treated with particular care, probably in scriptoria specializing in the production of luxury codices.
 The size of the sheets (332 x 323 mm) indicates the use of large hides, treated according to procedures that ensured uniform thickness and surface regularity. The almost square structure of the format suggests a careful design of the writing spaces, calibrated to the specific needs of Virgil's text and the need to harmoniously integrate text and illustrations.

The fascicle organization of the Vergilius Romanus follows assembly criteria that testify to the evolution of bookbinding techniques in the transition from antiquity to the Middle Ages. Codicological analysis has revealed that the original manuscript must have consisted of about 410 sheets, organized into regular fascicles according to a folding system that ensured structural stability and ease of consultation. The loss of over a hundred leaves over the centuries bears witness to the vicissitudes of conservation that have characterized the history of the codex, but also to the intrinsic fragility of the organic materials used in ancient book production. The reconstruction of the original fascicle structure has revealed a systematic organization that provided for the balanced distribution of the text in the different sections of the codex, with particular attention to the placement of miniatures in strategic positions with respect to the narrative flow. The numbering and organization system of the fascicles testifies to the existence of standardized procedures in late antique book production, which anticipate many of the technical characteristics of medieval codicography.

The technique used to prepare the parchment of the Vergilius Romanus documents the use of sophisticated procedures that ensured the durability and receptivity of the writing surface. Microscopic analysis of the writing surfaces revealed the use of scraping and smoothing techniques that produced a homogeneous and compact surface, ideal for the application of the inks and pigments used in illumination. The treatment of the hides probably involved the use of vegetable-based tanning substances, which gave the parchment resistance to moisture and atmospheric agents, crucial factors for the long-term preservation of the codices. The quality of the parchment used testifies to the existence of specialized suppliers capable of selecting and treating superior quality hides, probably organized into actual artisan guilds. The technical characteristics of the Vergilius Romanus parchment established quality standards that significantly influenced subsequent medieval book production.

The ruling system and the organization of the writing space in the Vergilius Romanus reveal layout criteria that anticipate many of the medieval graphic conventions. The text is distributed over 18 lines per page, according to a writing module that ensures visual balance and ease of reading, with proportionate margins that harmoniously frame the text and any miniatures. The ruling, probably executed with a drypoint, creates a regular grid that guides the arrangement of the letters and ensures the alignment of the lines, testifying to the existence of standardized techniques for the organization of writing spaces. The layout of the codex shows particular attention to the integration of text and images, with carefully calibrated spaces for the insertion of miniatures without compromising the legibility of the text. The layout system adopted testifies to the existence of highly specialized writing schools, capable of designing and implementing complex layouts that effectively integrated different textual and figurative components.

The type of ink used in the Vergilius Romanus testifies to the use of sophisticated chemical formulations that guaranteed the durability and color intensity of the written text. Spectroscopic analysis of the inks revealed the use of iron-based metallic inks, probably prepared according to traditional recipes that included the use of gallnuts, ferrous sulfate, and gum arabic.
 These inks, characterized by exceptional chemical stability and light resistance, have maintained their color intensity throughout fifteen centuries of history, testifying to the high quality of late antique chemical formulations. The preparation of inks required specialized technical skills and access to quality raw materials, factors that limited the production of luxury manuscripts to particularly well-equipped writing centers. The chromatic homogeneity of the ink used in the Vergilius Romanus suggests careful and professional preparation, probably carried out by specialists who provided their services to multiple writing workshops.

The graphic system adopted in the Vergilius Romanus, characterized by the use of rustic capital letters, represents a fundamental transition in the history of Latin paleography. The rustic capital letters used in the codex show formal characteristics that testify to the evolution of this type of writing towards more cursive and rapid forms, while maintaining the solemnity and elegance of classical capital letters. The calligraphic quality of the text reveals the hand of highly skilled scribes, probably trained in writing schools that kept Roman graphic traditions alive while adapting them to new production requirements. Paleographic analysis has highlighted stylistic variations that suggest the involvement of several scribes, testifying to the teamwork typical of large late antique book workshops. The treatment of abbreviations and diacritical marks shows the adoption of graphic conventions that anticipate many of the characteristics of medieval writing, positioning the Vergilius Romanus as a fundamental link in the evolutionary chain of Western writing.

The gilding technique used for the frames of the miniatures in the Vergilius Romanus testifies to the use of sophisticated metallurgical processes that ensured the brilliance and durability of the gold decorations. The application of gold leaf followed techniques that involved the preparation of adhesive bases made from organic glue, probably derived from animal or vegetable proteins, which ensured the stable adhesion of the precious metal to the parchment support. The quality of the gilding, which has retained its brilliance over the centuries, attests to the use of high-purity gold and refined application techniques, probably developed in the field of goldsmithing and adapted to the needs of book decoration. The gilded frames of the miniatures are not only decorative elements, but also perform a structural function in the visual organization of the page, separating the figurative spaces from the textual ones and creating perceptual hierarchies that guide the reader. The gilding technique of the Vergilius Romanus established quality standards that significantly influenced the art of medieval illumination.

The pigments used to create the miniatures in the Vergilius Romanus document the access of late antique artists to a wide range of mineral and vegetable dyes. Spectroscopic analysis has identified the use of seven different colors, obtained from high-quality pigments that testify to the existence of international trade networks for the supply of artistic raw materials. The colors used probably include cinnabar for reds, lapis lazuli for intense blues, malachite for greens, and orpiment for yellows, pigments that required particularly sophisticated extraction and preparation techniques. The chromatic stability of the miniatures, which have retained their vibrancy over the centuries, testifies not only to the quality of the pigments used, but also to the technical expertise of the artists in applying and fixing the colors. The use of such precious pigments indicates the luxurious nature of the commission and the considerable financial resources available to the patrons.

The binding technique of the Vergilius Romanus, although modified over the centuries through successive rebinding, retains traces of the original assembly procedures that testify to the evolution of late antique bookbinding. Analysis of the stitching and fastening systems of the fascicles reveals the use of techniques that anticipate many of the characteristics of medieval binding, with particular attention to structural stability and the protection of the block of sheets. The original stitching was probably made with linen or hemp threads, materials that guaranteed strength and flexibility, essential for the long-term preservation of large codices. The reinforcement systems of the hinges and fascicle joints testify to the existence of specific technical skills in the art of bookbinding, probably concentrated in specialized workshops that served the production of luxury books. The quality of the original binding contributed significantly to the survival of the codex through the centuries, protecting its precious contents from mechanical stress and atmospheric agents.

The conservation characteristics of the Vergilius Romanus document the effectiveness of the preservation techniques adopted in the various conservation contexts that have housed the manuscript throughout its thousand-year history. The current state of conservation, despite the loss of about a quarter of the original content, testifies to the resistance of the materials used and the effectiveness of the conservation care lavished on the codex in the various environments that have preserved it. Analysis of the conservation pathologies has revealed damage typical of the natural aging of organic supports, but also the positive effects of the traditional conservation practices adopted in large European libraries. The current conditions of conservation at the Vatican Apostolic Library guarantee the stabilization of degenerative processes and the long-term preservation of this exceptional cultural heritage. The Vergilius Romanus is now an exemplary case of the conservation of ancient book heritage, testifying to the effectiveness of the collaboration between traditional conservation skills and modern restoration techniques.

## Patrons and Provenance

The question of the identity of the patrons of the Vergilius Romanus remains one of the most debated and fascinating aspects in the history of the manuscript, as the lack of contemporary explicit or colophon prevents direct attribution, leaving room for hypotheses based on the analysis of the material and stylistic characteristics of the codex. The exceptional quality of the production, documented by the sumptuousness of the parchment, the refinement of the illustrations, and the use of precious materials such as gold leaf, suggests an aristocratic patronage of the highest level, probably belonging to the late Roman senatorial elites or the emerging provincial aristocracies. The choice to dedicate such a luxurious work to the works of Virgil indicates culturally refined patrons, capable of appreciating not only the literary value of the text, but also the symbolic and political implications of Virgil's work in the late antique context.
 The economic investment required for the creation of the codex suggests the availability of considerable wealth, typical of the great senatorial families who had maintained their social and economic position even during the transformations of the 5th century. The profile of the possible patrons is therefore that of cultured and wealthy aristocrats, part of the late antique cultural elites and sensitive to the symbolic value of preserving the classical literary heritage.

An analysis of the historical and political context of the fifth century provides useful information for defining the social environment from which the patronage of Vergilius Romanus may have emerged, an era characterized by the fragmentation of Western imperial power and the emergence of new elites in the peripheral provinces of the Empire. The political transformations of this period saw the rise of provincial aristocracies that sought to legitimize their position by maintaining links with Roman cultural tradition, using the commissioning of works of art and manuscripts as instruments of social prestige and identity affirmation. In this context, commissioning a luxury Virgilian codex could be a way of claiming continuity with the imperial cultural tradition and affirming their status as custodians of Roman civilization. The British elites of the fifth century, in particular, may have used similar commissions as instruments of cultural resistance in the face of pressure from Germanic populations, keeping the classical tradition alive through the production of codices of exceptional quality. The commissioning of the Vergilius Romanus is therefore part of a broader phenomenon of cultural renaissance promoted by provincial aristocracies in response to the political transformations of the time.

The possible British origin of the Vergilius Romanus, hypothesized by some scholars on the basis of stylistic and iconographic elements, would open up fascinating scenarios regarding the commissioning of the manuscript and its role in the culture of late Roman Britain. If confirmed, this hypothesis would place the commissioning of the codex in the context of the Roman-British aristocracies of the 5th century, a context characterized by the coexistence of Roman cultural traditions and local Celtic influences. The British elites of this period, heirs to the senatorial families who had ruled the province during the imperial period, may have commissioned works such as the Vergilius Romanus to assert their Roman cultural identity in the face of growing pressure from the Anglo-Saxon populations. In this context, the choice of Virgil as the author to be celebrated would take on particular symbolic significance, since the Aeneid represented the founding epic of Roman civilization and could therefore serve as a symbol of cultural resistance. The British patronage would also explain some stylistic features of the manuscript, which seem to reflect artistic influences different from those prevalent in continental cultural centers.

The monastic environment, although traditionally associated with the preservation rather than the commissioning of classical manuscripts, may have played a role in the genesis of the Vergilius Romanus, especially in a chronological context in which the boundaries between secular and ecclesiastical culture were less rigid than they would become in subsequent centuries. The hypothesis of a monastic or para-monastic patronage would gain particular credibility if we consider the role that some monastic centers of the fifth and sixth centuries played in the preservation and transmission of classical culture, often under the patronage of aristocrats who had converted to Christianity.
 The great monasteries of the time, often founded or supported by aristocratic families, had the economic resources and technical skills necessary for the production of luxury codices, and the presence of monastic libraries rich in classical texts is well documented for this period. In this scenario, the commission of the Vergilius Romanus could be traced back to a cultured and refined monastic environment, capable of appreciating the literary and artistic value of Virgil's work even within a Christian ideological framework. The blending of classical and Christian culture, typical of the fifth century, would make it plausible for a monastic patron to commission a work dedicated to a pagan author who was universally recognized as a classic.

The presence of the Vergilius Romanus in the Abbey of Saint-Denis during the medieval period provides important clues about the history of its patronage and its circulation among the cultural elites of Europe. The Abbey of Saint-Denis, founded in the 7th century and which became one of the most important religious and cultural centers of the Frankish kingdom, housed a library of extraordinary wealth that included both sacred texts and classical works. The presence of the codex in this prestigious monastic center suggests that the manuscript circulated in the most refined cultural circles of early medieval Europe, probably through networks of exchange and donation involving the most important aristocratic families of the time. The Abbey of Saint-Denis was closely linked to the Frankish royal dynasty and later to the Capetian dynasty, and its library regularly received donations from kings, nobles, and high prelates. In this context, the arrival of the Vergilius Romanus in Saint-Denis could be the result of an aristocratic donation or an acquisition sought by the monks to enrich their collection of classical manuscripts.

Analysis of the iconographic characteristics of the Vergilius Romanus provides elements for reconstructing the cultural and ideological profile of the patrons, revealing artistic preferences and interpretative choices that reflect specific cultural orientations. The miniatures in the codex show particular attention to the narrative aspects of Virgil's texts, with a preference for battle scenes, mythological episodes, and representations of divine figures, choices that may reflect the tastes and preferences of an aristocratic patron interested in warrior values and heroic epics. The representation of divine figures according to iconographies showing both classical and proto-Christian influences suggests a cultural environment open to ideological contamination, typical of late antique elites who sought to reconcile pagan tradition and new Christian religiosity. The artistic quality of the miniatures and their stylistic consistency indicate that the patrons had not only the necessary financial resources but also the cultural expertise to direct a complex and sophisticated artistic project. The iconographic choices of the Vergilius Romanus thus reveal a culturally refined patronage, capable of using art as a tool for ideological expression and social affirmation.

The circulation network of the Vergilius Romanus between its creation in the 5th century and its documented presence in Saint-Denis in the medieval period remains largely unknown, but the available traces suggest a route that probably involved multiple aristocracies and cultural centers. The exceptional quality of the codex and its cultural importance suggest that the manuscript circulated in the most refined circles of late antique and early medieval society, probably through donations, inheritances, or prestigious acquisitions. The presence of contemporary annotations and traces of use testifies that the codex was actively used for reading and study, indicating that its successive owners shared with the original patrons a genuine interest in classical culture. The circulation of the manuscript may have followed the commercial and cultural routes that connected the different regions of early medieval Europe, passing from hand to hand through aristocratic networks that kept interest in classical texts alive. The journey of the Vergilius Romanus thus testifies to the existence of a European aristocratic culture capable of appreciating and preserving the masterpieces of the classical tradition even during the most difficult centuries of the early Middle Ages.

The question of who commissioned the Vergilius Romanus intersects with the broader issues of the survival and transmission of classical culture in the late antique world, representing an exemplary case of cultural patronage in an era of transformation. The patrons of the codex, whoever they were, actively participated in the process of preserving Latin literary heritage, assuming cultural and economic responsibility for ensuring the survival of one of the masterpieces of world literature. Their decision to invest considerable resources in the production of a codex of such quality testifies to the persistence of classical cultural values even in an era of profound religious and political transformation. The role of the patrons of the Vergilius Romanus is part of a tradition of aristocratic patronage that has its roots in the Republican and Imperial eras, but which found new forms of expression in the 5th century linked to the specific cultural preservation needs of the time. Their actions had long-term historical consequences, contributing to the transmission of classical culture to future generations and keeping Western cultural heritage alive during one of the most critical periods in its history.

The cultural legacy of the Vergilius Romanus commission extends well beyond the fifth century, influencing the models of book patronage that would characterize medieval and Renaissance European culture. The example set by the commission of the codex established quality standards and production models that significantly influenced subsequent book production, demonstrating the possibility of reconciling the preservation of classical culture with artistic innovation. The patrons of the manuscript anticipated, in some ways, the phenomenon of humanistic collecting, showing how the commissioning of works of art can become an instrument of cultural and social affirmation. Their cultural vision, which saw the preservation of classical texts as a civic duty and an investment for future generations, foreshadowed the cultural orientations that would characterize medieval and Renaissance Europe. The Vergilius Romanus therefore represents not only the result of a 5th-century aristocratic commission, but also the symbol of a European cultural tradition that finds one of its fundamental identities in the preservation of the classical heritage. The foresight of its patrons contributed to the formation of the cultural continuity that is one of the distinctive features of Western civilization.

## Location of the Scriptorium

The question of the location of the scriptorium that produced the Vergilius Romanus is one of the most complex and debated issues in the history of the manuscript, as the absence of explicit or contemporary subscriptions prevents direct identification of the center of production. Analysis of the paleographic, codicological, and stylistic characteristics of the codex has led scholars to formulate various hypotheses about its location, ranging from the British provinces to northern Italy, from Gaul to Spain, reflecting the cultural complexity of the late antique world and the difficulty of establishing unambiguous geographical criteria for 5th-century book production.
 The rustic capital letters used in the manuscript show formal characteristics which, while fitting into the Roman writing tradition, have peculiarities that could indicate local adaptations or specific regional influences. The exceptional quality of the production suggests a highly specialized scriptorium, probably linked to an important cultural or political center, equipped with the technical and human resources necessary to produce such a refined work. The location of the scriptorium therefore remains an open question, requiring the integration of multiple lines of investigation to reach convincing conclusions.

The hypothesis of a British location for the Vergilius Romanus, supported mainly by Martin Henig, is based on stylistic analysis of the miniatures and on certain iconographic features that seem to reflect artistic influences peculiar to the British cultural environment of the 5th century. According to this theory, the codex would have been produced in a scriptorium in late Roman Britain, probably linked to one of the urban centers that maintained cultural vitality even after the withdrawal of the Roman legions. The art of the miniatures shows stylistic elements that deviate from continental artistic conventions, suggesting the existence of local artistic traditions that combined classical Roman elements with pre-Roman Celtic influences. The presence of iconographic details that could reflect elements of the British landscape or local mythological traditions would further support this hypothesis. However, the British location remains controversial, as many of the stylistic elements cited in its support could also be explained as the result of different artistic influences, not necessarily linked to an insular production environment.

The alternative Irish location of the Vergilius Romanus, based on textual analysis and comparisons with Irish commentaries on Virgilian texts, opens up even more fascinating scenarios regarding the spread of classical culture in the peripheral territories of late antique Europe. This hypothesis is based on the presence of textual lessons and variants that seem to be shared with exegetical traditions documented in the insular environment, suggesting possible links between the scriptorium that produced the codex and the Irish centers of study that cultivated the classical tradition during the early medieval centuries. In fact, 5th-6th century Ireland saw the development of a monastic culture particularly attentive to the preservation of classical texts, and the presence of Irish scriptoria capable of producing high-quality works is well documented by contemporary sources. The Irish location would also explain some technical characteristics of the manuscript, which may reflect production traditions developed in an insular environment. However, this hypothesis also remains speculative and requires further investigation to be definitively confirmed or refuted.

The possibility of a continental location for the Vergilius Romanus in the Gallic provinces is supported by the characteristics of the rustic capitals used in the codex, which show similarities with scriptural productions documented in scriptoria centers in southern Gaul. The large urban centers of late antique Gaul, such as Lyon, Arles, or Marseille, had the cultural and economic structures necessary to support the production of luxury codices, and the presence of scriptoria linked to rhetorical schools and urban libraries is well documented by sources.
 The Gallic cultural tradition of the fifth century maintained strong links with classical Roman culture, and the presence of a cultured and refined aristocracy provided the ideal social context for the commissioning of works such as the Vergilius Romanus. A comparative analysis of the graphic and codicological characteristics of the codex with other manuscripts of probable Gallic origin reveals significant similarities in layout techniques, parchment preparation, and the organization of scriptorium work. The Gallic location is therefore one of the most credible hypotheses, supported by a solid historical and cultural context and convincing paleographic evidence.

The hypothesis of an Italian production of the Vergilius Romanus, although less developed in specific studies, is justified by the fact that Italy was still one of the main centers of luxury book production in the 5th century and kept alive the technical and artistic traditions of classical Roman culture. Rome itself, despite the political transformations of the time, remained a cultural center of primary importance, home to aristocratic libraries and scriptoria connected to the great senatorial families who had maintained their social and economic position. The presence in the Vatican Apostolic Library of other contemporary Virgilian manuscripts (Vergilius Vaticanus, Vergilius Augusteus) suggests the existence in the Roman environment of a tradition of producing luxury Virgilian codices, which may also have included the Vergilius Romanus. Northern Italy, in particular, maintained considerable cultural vitality in the fifth century, with centers such as Milan, Ravenna, and Aquileia serving as important hubs of late antique culture. The Italian location would explain the exceptional quality of the codex and its technical characteristics, which reflect established craft traditions and access to first-rate materials.

Analysis of the artistic techniques used in the miniatures of the Vergilius Romanus provides useful clues for locating the scriptorium, revealing stylistic influences that could indicate specific artistic production environments. The stylistic characteristics of the miniatures show an original synthesis between classical artistic tradition and innovative elements that anticipate medieval art, a combination that could be indicative of particularly vibrant cultural environments open to different artistic influences. The technique of color application and the use of gilding reveal specialized technical skills that suggest a scriptorium linked to high-level artistic workshops, probably also active in the production of art objects and architectural decorations. The iconography adopted in the miniatures shows familiarity with artistic repertoires that circulated in the most refined cultural circles of the time, suggesting a location in culturally vibrant centers well connected to international artistic networks. The stylistic analysis of the miniatures therefore supports hypotheses of location in important cultural centers, capable of attracting skilled artists and supporting artistic productions of exceptional quality.

The codicological characteristics of the Vergilius Romanus provide further elements for discussion on the location of the scriptorium, revealing technical traditions that could be indicative of specific book production environments. The quality of the parchment used and the techniques of preparation of the writing support suggest access to specialized suppliers and high technical skills, factors that limit the possible locations to centers with developed production infrastructures. The fascicle organization of the codex and the numbering systems used show similarities with procedures documented in scriptoria in different geographical areas, making precise identification difficult but confirming its belonging to established production traditions. The size of the codex and the complexity of its textual organization required specific design skills, suggesting a highly organized scriptorium specializing in the production of luxury codices. The codicological characteristics of the Vergilius Romanus therefore testify to the existence of book production centers with high technical and organizational skills, probably located in culturally vibrant areas of the late antique world.

The question of the tools and resources needed to produce the Vergilius Romanus provides useful information for narrowing down the possible locations of the scriptorium, since the creation of such a complex work required access to specialized materials and technical skills that were unevenly distributed geographically. The availability of high-quality parchment, stable metallic inks, precious pigments, and gold leaf required connections with international trade networks and access to specialized suppliers, factors that favored locations in major urban centers or near strategic trade routes. The technical skills required for the creation of miniatures and the application of gilding suggest the presence of specialized artistic workshops, probably also active in production sectors other than book decoration. The complexity of the project also required organizational and coordination skills that suggest well-organized production structures, probably linked to cultural or religious institutions with stable resources. Analysis of the resources necessary for the production of the Vergilius Romanus therefore points to locations in culturally and economically developed centers of the late antique world.

The network of circulation and dissemination of the Vergilius Romanus after its creation could offer clues as to the original location of the scriptorium, since the circulation routes of luxury manuscripts often followed predictable routes linked to the cultural and political relations of the time. The documented presence of the codex in the Abbey of Saint-Denis during the medieval period suggests links with Franco-Gallic cultural networks, which could indicate that the scriptorium originated in areas geographically or culturally connected with these territories. The exceptional quality of the codex and its cultural importance suggest that its circulation probably involved the most refined cultural elites of early medieval Europe, following routes that could reveal clues about its original provenance. The patterns of circulation of classical manuscripts in the late antique and early medieval world show that works of such importance tended to remain within restricted cultural circles, facilitating their preservation but also limiting the possibility of reconstructing precise transmission routes. The analysis of the circulation of the Vergilius Romanus therefore remains an important but not conclusive element in determining the original location of the scriptorium.

The question of the location of the Vergilius Romanus scriptorium remains fundamentally open, testifying to the cultural complexity of the late antique world and the difficulty of establishing unambiguous geographical criteria for 5th-century book production. The various hypotheses put forward by scholars reflect the richness and variety of late antique cultural centers, all potentially capable of producing works of such quality and importance. The lack of definitive evidence suggests that locating the codex may require the integration of different investigative methodologies, from scientific analysis of materials to comparative studies of larger manuscript corpora. However, the uncertainty about its location does not diminish the importance of the codex as a testimony to the cultural vitality of the late antique world and the ability of its elites to produce works of exceptional artistic and cultural quality.
 The Vergilius Romanus is therefore a paradigmatic example of late antique book production, regardless of its specific location, testifying to the existence of highly specialized scriptoria capable of producing masterpieces that would influence European culture for many centuries. The question of its geographical origin remains an open challenge for future research, an enigma that continues to stimulate the interest of scholars and enrich our understanding of the late antique cultural world.

## Transmission and Current Location

The history of the transmission of the Vergilius Romanus through the centuries is an exemplary case of the preservation of European cultural heritage, documenting the paths through which the masterpieces of ancient culture have reached the contemporary era. The first historically documented place of preservation of the codex is the Abbey of Saint-Denis, where the manuscript remained for many centuries, benefiting from the protection offered by one of the most prestigious monastic centers in Europe. The abbey, founded in the 7th century and which became the burial place of the kings of France, had an exceptional library and established conservation traditions that ensured the codex's survival through the most difficult centuries of the early Middle Ages. The presence of the Vergilius Romanus in this monastic environment testifies to the fundamental role played by the great monasteries in the preservation of classical cultural heritage, a function that proved decisive for the transmission of ancient culture to subsequent generations. The conditions of preservation at Saint-Denis, although not always ideal according to modern archival standards, proved sufficient to ensure the survival of the work through almost a millennium of European history.

The transfer of the Vergilius Romanus from the Abbey of Saint-Denis to the Vatican Apostolic Library in the 15th century represents a crucial moment in the conservation history of the manuscript, marking the codex's entry into one of the most important library centers in the Christian world. The precise circumstances of this transfer remain unclear in the documentary sources, but it is likely that the codex arrived in Rome through donations or acquisitions linked to the complex cultural and political relations between France and the Papal States during the Renaissance. The Vatican Library, formally founded by Sixtus IV in 1475 but heir to much older papal book collections, was the ideal environment for the preservation of a work of such cultural and artistic importance. The transfer coincided with the period of greatest expansion of the Vatican collections, when humanist popes actively promoted the acquisition of ancient manuscripts and the formation of a universal library that would document the entire cultural heritage of humanity. The arrival of the Vergilius Romanus in the Vatican thus marked the beginning of a new phase of conservation, characterized by more advanced scientific criteria and a greater awareness of the historical importance of the manuscript heritage.

The conditions of preservation of the Vergilius Romanus during its time in the Vatican show the evolution of library and conservation practices from the Renaissance to the present day, testifying to the progress made in safeguarding cultural heritage.
 During the first centuries of its stay in the Vatican, the codex was probably preserved according to the traditional procedures of the time, which involved storage in climatically stable environments that were not always optimal according to modern conservation standards. Renaissance and Baroque consultation practices, which allowed direct access to manuscripts even for external scholars, inevitably led to mechanical stress that contributed to the deterioration of some parts of the codex. The introduction of more rigorous conservation criteria during the 18th and 19th centuries led to greater protection of the manuscript, with restrictions on access and more careful handling procedures. The 20th century marked a decisive turning point in conservation practices, with the introduction of advanced technologies for environmental control, chemical stabilization of ancient materials, and digitization to reduce the need for direct consultation.

The current location of the Vergilius Romanus at the Vatican Apostolic Library, where it is catalogued as Vat. lat. 3867, represents the culmination of a long conservation tradition that has ensured the survival of the codex through fifteen centuries of European history. The modern Vatican library has state-of-the-art conservation facilities, with environmental control systems that maintain constant temperature and humidity, controlled lighting to prevent photochemical damage, and security systems that provide protection against theft, fire, and other catastrophic events. The manuscript is stored in specially designed containers that protect the binding from mechanical stress and prevent the accumulation of dust and atmospheric pollutants. Current consultation procedures strictly limit direct access to the manuscript, favoring the use of high-resolution digital reproductions that allow for detailed study without compromising the integrity of the original. The Vatican's location guarantees optimal conservation conditions for the Vergilius Romanus and controlled access that meets the needs of scientific research without compromising long-term conservation.

The Vergilius Romanus digitization project, carried out by the Vatican Apostolic Library as part of the broader DigiVatLib program, represents a milestone in the accessibility of the manuscript and its dissemination to the international scientific community. High-resolution digitization has made it possible to document every detail of the codex, from its codicological characteristics to its paleographic features, from the painting techniques used in the miniatures to the details of the gold decoration. This digital documentation not only facilitates international scientific research, but also represents a form of conservation insurance, ensuring that the information contained in the manuscript remains accessible even in the event of catastrophic events that could compromise the original. The digitization project has also allowed for the application of advanced digital analysis techniques, which reveal details invisible to the naked eye and enable non-invasive studies of the materials and construction techniques of the codex. The digital accessibility of the Vergilius Romanus therefore represents a democratization of access to this cultural heritage, allowing scholars from all over the world to consult the manuscript without the geographical and economic limitations that traditionally characterized research on ancient manuscripts.

Modern scientific studies of the Vergilius Romanus have benefited enormously from new conservation and analytical technologies, allowing insights that were unthinkable in previous eras.
 David H. Wright's codicological research, published in “Codicological Notes on the Vergilius Romanus,” has set new methodological standards for the scientific analysis of ancient manuscripts, combining direct observation, instrumental analysis, and systematic comparisons with other contemporary witnesses. Erwin Rosenthal's studies on the illuminations of the codex have opened up new perspectives for research on the evolution of late antique book art, while Kurt Weitzmann's analyses have placed the manuscript in the broader context of early Christian art. The use of non-invasive analytical techniques, such as reflectance spectroscopy and multispectral imaging, has made it possible to identify the materials used in the miniatures and to document the state of preservation of the codex with scientific precision. These studies have transformed the Vergilius Romanus from an art object and historical document into a veritable interdisciplinary research laboratory, bringing together paleographic, codicological, artistic, and technological expertise.

Contemporary consultation of the Vergilius Romanus follows strictly controlled procedures that balance the needs of scientific research with the imperatives of long-term conservation. Access to the original manuscript is reserved for research projects of particular scientific importance that cannot be carried out through consultation of digital reproductions. Requests for consultation are evaluated by a scientific committee that considers the relevance of the research, the competence of the applicant, and the actual need to access the original rather than reproductions. When authorized, consultation takes place in specially equipped rooms, under the supervision of qualified personnel and with the use of tools that minimize mechanical stress on the manuscript. Consultation sessions are limited in time and documented photographically to monitor the impact on the integrity of the codex. These rigorous procedures ensure that the Vergilius Romanus remains accessible to scientific research without compromising its preservation for future generations.

The role of the Vergilius Romanus in the contemporary cultural landscape transcends its function as a historical document, taking on symbolic value as a witness to European cultural continuity and the heritage of humanity as a whole. The manuscript is regularly included in major international exhibitions dedicated to medieval art and the history of the book, where it represents one of the most significant examples of late antique book production. Its image is used in scientific publications, educational materials, and cultural outreach initiatives that aim to raise public awareness of the importance of preserving manuscript heritage. The codex also inspires interdisciplinary research involving art historians, philologists, paleographers, restorers, and technologists, contributing to the development of innovative methodologies for the study and conservation of ancient manuscripts. The presence of the Vergilius Romanus in the Vatican collections makes it an ambassador of European culture throughout the world, a symbol of the richness of Western cultural heritage and its ability to cross the centuries while maintaining its expressive power and documentary value intact.

The future conservation of the Vergilius Romanus will depend on the ability of cultural institutions to adapt conservation strategies to evolving environmental threats and new possibilities offered by technology. Climate change and atmospheric pollution pose new challenges for the conservation of ancient organic materials, requiring constant updating of environmental control systems and conservation procedures. However, the evolution of digital technologies offers new opportunities for the documentation, study, and dissemination of manuscript heritage, allowing for increasingly sophisticated and immersive forms of virtual access. Conservation restoration techniques continue to evolve, integrating traditional methodologies and scientific innovations to ensure increasingly less invasive and more effective interventions.

## Transmission and current location

The transmission of the Vergilius Romanus through the millennia represents one of the most extraordinary stories of conservation in European cultural heritage, testifying to the resilience of a work that has survived fifteen centuries of political, social, and cultural transformations unscathed. The first documented phase of its transmission coincides with late antiquity and the early Middle Ages, when the codex probably circulated in the aristocratic circles of the declining Western Roman Empire, before finding refuge in monastic or aristocratic contexts that ensured its survival during the most difficult centuries of the early Middle Ages. The traces of use found in the manuscript, including medieval corrections and contemporary annotations, testify that the work was not simply preserved as a cultural relic, but continued to be actively used for reading and studying Virgil's texts. Its survival through the barbarian invasions, the fall of the Western Roman Empire, and the political fragmentation of early medieval Europe represents a miracle of conservation that documents the existence of cultural elites capable of keeping the classical tradition alive even in the most adverse circumstances. The exceptional quality of its preservation, despite the loss of about a quarter of its original content, testifies to the care and attention with which the work was preserved in the various environments that housed it during its long history.

The arrival of the Vergilius Romanus at the Abbey of Saint-Denis represents a crucial moment in its history of preservation, marking the entry of the codex into one of the most prestigious and culturally vibrant monastic centers of medieval Europe. The Abbey of Saint-Denis, founded in the 7th century and which became the burial place of the kings of France, had an exceptional library that included both sacred texts and classical works, representing an ideal environment for the preservation of a manuscript of such cultural importance. The presence of the codex in this monastic context is documented with certainty throughout the medieval period, testifying to its recognition by the French ecclesiastical elites, who considered it one of the treasures of their book collection. The precise circumstances of the manuscript's arrival in Saint-Denis remain uncertain, but it is possible that the codex came to the abbey via Charlemagne's library, which, according to some hypotheses, acquired the manuscript during his stays in Italy and then donated it to the prestigious Parisian monastery. The Vergilius Romanus' long stay at Saint-Denis, documented until the 15th century, ensured its survival through a particularly delicate period for the preservation of classical cultural heritage, when many other examples of ancient literature were lost forever.

The documentation of the presence of the Vergilius Romanus at the Abbey of Saint-Denis during the medieval period reveals the special attention with which the manuscript was preserved and studied by the monks of the Parisian monastery.
 In the 12th century, almost forty small corrections were carefully inserted into the text of the codex, representing a unique case of philological study of an ancient book at that time, testimony to the intellectual vitality of the monastic environment of Saint-Denis and the recognition of the textual value of Virgil's work. The philological care shown by the monks in making these corrections indicates not only the availability of other Virgilian witnesses for comparison, but also the existence of refined textual skills that allowed for accurate and scientifically based critical interventions. The influence of the manuscript on the monastic culture of the time is documented by the citation of a particular textual variant (Minoeia for Minoia in Aeneid 6.14) by Herico of Auxerre around 865 in his Life of Saint Germanus, demonstrating that the work was known and used even outside the environment of Saint-Denis. The long tradition of study and preservation of the codex at the abbey contributed significantly to its survival and the preservation of its textual and artistic integrity.

The transfer of the Vergilius Romanus from the Abbey of Saint-Denis to the Vatican Apostolic Library in the second half of the 15th century marks a decisive turning point in the conservation history of the manuscript and its entry into the most important library in the Christian world. The last evidence of the codex's presence in Saint-Denis is represented by the signature of Abbot Jehan Courtoys (1441-1443), who affixed his name to the manuscript, but as early as 1475, the codex appears in the first inventory of the Vatican Library established by Pope Sixtus IV. The precise circumstances of this transfer remain unclear in the documentary sources, but it is likely that the manuscript arrived in Rome through the complex diplomatic and cultural relations between France and the Papal States during the Renaissance, perhaps on the occasion of one of the councils attended by French prelates at the papal court. The Vatican Library, formally established by Sixtus IV in 1475 with the bull “Ad decorem militantis Ecclesiae,” was the ideal environment for the preservation of a work of such importance, as it had the financial resources, technical expertise, and institutional stability necessary to ensure the long-term protection of cultural heritage. The entry of the Vergilius Romanus into the Vatican collections coincided with the period of greatest expansion of the papal library, when humanist popes actively promoted the acquisition of ancient manuscripts to form a universal collection that would document the entire cultural heritage of humanity.

The Vergilius Romanus was welcomed into the Vatican Library with immediate recognition of its exceptional cultural and artistic value, as evidenced by the interest shown by the most important scholars of the time. Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere, the future Pope Julius II, borrowed the manuscript for study as early as 1475, the year it was cataloged in the papal library, demonstrating the immediate attention the work aroused in Roman humanist circles. In 1484, the Florentine scholar Angelo Poliziano carefully examined the codex during his stay in Rome, using its colophons to establish the correct spelling “Vergilius” instead of the medieval form “Virgilius,” thus contributing to philological studies on the Virgilian textual tradition. The Roman scholar Pierio Valeriano conducted detailed studies of the manuscript for his edition of Virgil's text published in 1521, coining the name “Codex Romanus” for the work because of the authentically Roman quality of its writing. This intense scholarly interest testifies to the immediate recognition of the codex's importance for classical and philological studies, establishing a tradition of research that continues to this day.

The current location of the Vergilius Romanus in the Vatican Apostolic Library, where it is catalogued as Vat. lat. 3867, represents the culmination of a thousand-year-old tradition of conservation that has ensured the survival of this cultural heritage through the vicissitudes of European history.
