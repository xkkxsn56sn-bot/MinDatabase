# Copilot Instructions: MinePapirer/Papirer

## Project Overview
This is an academic/scholarly writing repository focused on art history, particularly Medieval and Renaissance Italian art. Currently contains detailed art historical essays written in a highly academic, analytical style.

## Content & Writing Style

### Core Characteristics
- **Discipline**: Art history with focus on Italian Medieval/Renaissance painting
- **Style**: Dense academic prose with extensive historical contextualization
- **Length**: Long-form essays (typically 5,000-15,000+ words)
- **Citation approach**: Currently narrative-driven with footnote references (see `[^1]` format)
- **Language**: English, with Italian/Latin terms where historically appropriate

### Structural Patterns (observed in existing content)
1. **Hierarchical headings**: Use `##` for major sections, descriptive titles
2. **Opening contextual paragraphs**: Begin sections with broad historical/institutional context before focusing
3. **Multi-paragraph development**: Each section develops ideas across 3-7 substantial paragraphs
4. **Integrated evidence**: Weave documentary evidence, material details, and interpretation together
5. **Technical precision**: Include specific measurements, dates, materials when discussing artworks

### Analytical Approach
- **Material culture emphasis**: Describe physical properties (dimensions, materials, techniques)
- **Institutional context**: Situate artworks within commissioning institutions (monasteries, churches, orders)
- **Documentary evidence**: Reference archival records, notarial acts, property transactions
- **Theological dimension**: Connect visual choices to doctrinal/devotional shifts
- **Historiographical awareness**: Discuss scholarly debates and restoration history (e.g., Cesare Brandi)

### Domain-Specific Conventions
- Use Italian ecclesiastical terms naturally: *basilica*, *bottega*, *dossal*, *tramezzo*, *Christus Patiens*
- Reference medieval orders formally: "Order of Preachers (Ordo Praedicatorum)" for Dominicans
- Include Latin inscriptions verbatim when relevant: e.g., "CUIUS DOCTA MANUS ME PINXIT IUNTA PISANUS"
- Date format: "1250-1254" or "mid-thirteenth century"
- Dimensions: metric (centimeters) for artworks

## File Organization
- **Location**: Essays stored directly in `/Papirer` directory
- **Naming**: Format appears to be `[Artist Name]-[Work Title].md`
- **No subdirectories**: Currently flat structure

## When Creating New Content

### For Art Historical Essays
1. Begin with clear title establishing artist, work, and significance
2. Open with contextual section establishing the work's importance and physical properties
3. Include biographical section on artist (with documentary evidence where available)
4. Discuss institutional/patronage context (who commissioned, why, rivalries)
5. Address iconographic innovations and theological significance
6. Cover material history (relocations, restorations, conservation)
7. Engage with scholarly debates and historiography

### For Editing Existing Content
- Maintain the established dense, analytical tone
- Add citations inline as `[^n]` format when referencing scholarship
- Preserve technical precision in measurements, dates, and documentary references
- Expand rather than simplify—this project values comprehensive contextual analysis

### Avoid
- Simplified or "accessible" rewrites—the scholarly density is intentional
- Removing technical art historical terminology
- Condensing multi-paragraph developments into single paragraphs
- Generic statements without specific evidence

## Research Integration
When expanding content, prioritize:
1. **Documentary evidence**: Notarial records, archival references, contemporary accounts
2. **Material analysis**: Technical studies, restoration reports, conservation findings
3. **Comparative context**: Related works by same artist or contemporary painters
4. **Institutional records**: Monastic chronicles, ecclesiastical documents, property records

## Example Patterns from Existing Content

**Opening a major artwork description**:
> "The Crucifix of Saint Dominic, completed between 1250 and 1254, represents one of the most consequential works in Western medieval art and marks a decisive rupture with the visual traditions..."

**Integrating documentary evidence**:
> "Documentary evidence places him in Rome in 1239, where he is recorded as maintaining an active bottega with at least one apprentice..."

**Material/technical description**:
> "The work is executed on a poplar panel constructed from vertical boards joined with careful joinery and sealed with gesso—a preparation layer composed of plaster, animal glue, and chalk..."

**Historiographical engagement**:
> "The restoration conducted under the direction of Cesare Brandi in 1935–1936 constituted a watershed moment in the modern scholarship..."

## Additional Notes
- This repository appears to be personal scholarly writing ("MinePapirer" = "My Papers")
- Quality bar is high—content demonstrates graduate-level or professional art historical research
- No build/test processes—purely markdown-based writing project
- Consider each essay as a standalone publishable article in structure and rigor
