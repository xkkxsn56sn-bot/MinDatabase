***

Bartolomeo da Camogli, also known as Bartolomeo Pellerano or Bartolomeus de Camulio, represents a crucial yet understudied figure in the development of fourteenth-century Mediterranean painting. Born around 1300 in Camogli, a small coastal town near Genoa in the Republic of Genoa, the artist emerged during a period of significant artistic ferment in the Ligurian capital. His birth date can be reasonably estimated from documentary evidence that places him as an active master painter by 1339, suggesting he would have completed his apprenticeship and achieved independent status by his mid-to-late thirties. The precise circumstances of his birth remain undocumented, though his family origins in the maritime community of Camogli suggest connections to the mercantile networks that characterized Genoese society. Camogli itself, situated on the Ligurian Riviera, was a modest settlement whose artistic production was naturally oriented toward the dominant cultural center of Genoa. The artist's early life coincided with Genoa's period as a major Mediterranean maritime power, a status that would prove decisive in shaping his artistic opportunities and the diffusion of his work. His formative years unfolded against the backdrop of intense commercial activity between Genoa and other Mediterranean ports, particularly in Sicily, North Africa, and the Eastern Mediterranean. The artist's family name, Pellerano, suggests possible connections to a lineage of artisans or craftsmen, though the specific origins of this surname remain obscure. His alternative designation "da Camogli" served primarily to distinguish him from other painters named Bartolomeo active in Genoa during the same period. The cultural milieu of his birthplace, though provincial, maintained connections to the sophisticated artistic developments occurring in Genoa and beyond.[^1_1][^1_2][^1_3][^1_4][^1_5][^1_6]

### Family Background and Lineage

The most significant documented connection in Bartolomeo's family concerns his probable father, Opizzino Pellerano da Camogli, a painter active in Genoa from 1302 to 1325 who died before 1361. Opizzino represents a crucial link in understanding Bartolomeo's artistic formation, as modern scholarship has proposed identifying this earlier Pellerano with the Master of Santa Maria di Castello, a conventional designation for an artist whose work demonstrates familiarity with pre-Giottesque Sienese painting and Cimabue's Assisian frescoes. If this identification holds, it establishes a direct transmission of sophisticated artistic knowledge within the Pellerano family workshop. The Master of Santa Maria di Castello's oeuvre reveals a painter trained in contact with Sienese experiences and especially with the pre-Giottesque Assisian works of Cimabuesque character, represented in Genoa between 1292 and 1293 by the Pistoiese painter Manfredino d'Alberto. Bartolomeo's artistic vocabulary strongly suggests he received his initial training in his father's workshop, absorbing the fundamental techniques and stylistic orientations that characterized Opizzino's production. The family workshop appears to have maintained a consistent presence in the Genoese artistic landscape across at least two generations, suggesting a degree of professional success and social stability. Documentary evidence also indicates that Bartolomeo may have had a brother, Antonio Pellerano, who was documented as a painter in 1341, though the specific nature of their relationship and any professional collaboration remains undocumented. The presence of multiple painters within a single family reflects the typical organization of medieval artistic production, where craft knowledge passed through familial networks and workshop training. The Pellerano family's origins in Camogli rather than Genoa proper may have influenced their social status within the city's artistic hierarchy, though they clearly achieved sufficient recognition to maintain an active workshop. The family's persistence across decades suggests they successfully navigated the competitive environment of Genoese painting, which included both local masters and immigrant artists from Tuscany and Lombardy. Evidence of the family's workshop organization emerges from the 1339 document recording Bartolomeo's acceptance of an apprentice, indicating he had achieved master status and possessed the infrastructure to train younger painters.[^1_3][^1_4][^1_5]

### Patronage Networks and Clientele

The documented patronage networks surrounding Bartolomeo da Camogli reveal the complex web of commercial, religious, and civic relationships that sustained artistic production in fourteenth-century Genoa. The most significant commission documented in contemporary sources dates to March 30, 1346, when Bartolomeo received a contract to execute an altarpiece for the church of San Siro in Genoa, one of the city's most important religious institutions. This commission indicates that by the mid-1340s, the painter had achieved sufficient reputation to secure major ecclesiastical commissions within Genoa itself. The church of San Siro, as a prominent Genoese religious foundation, would have represented a prestigious patron whose selection of Bartolomeo signals the artist's standing within the local artistic community. Unfortunately, this altarpiece has not survived or remains unidentified, preventing detailed analysis of how Bartolomeo adapted his style to meet the specific devotional and aesthetic requirements of this Genoese patron. The artist's most famous surviving work, the Madonna dell'Umiltà signed and dated 1346, presents more complex questions regarding patronage. The painting's original location in the cloister of San Francesco in Palermo, where the Genoese community maintained a chapel, strongly suggests commission by Genoese merchants or officials resident in Sicily. The Genoese presence in Palermo was substantial during the fourteenth century, as the Republic of Genoa maintained significant commercial interests throughout Sicily. These merchants and their families would have constituted a natural clientele for a Genoese painter, seeking works that reflected both their cultural origins and the artistic sophistication of their adopted city. The choice of the Madonna dell'Umiltà iconography may reflect specific devotional preferences of this mercantile community or the religious confraternity that commissioned the work. The painting's presence in a Franciscan context is noteworthy, as the mendicant orders actively promoted themes of humility and poverty, making the Madonna dell'Umiltà particularly appropriate for their churches. Whether Bartolomeo traveled to Sicily to execute this commission or completed it in Genoa for shipment remains uncertain, though the latter scenario appears more likely given the established patterns of artistic export from Genoa to its Mediterranean commercial network.[^1_2][^1_7][^1_6][^1_3]

Bartolomeo's workshop location near the Palazzo dell'Abate del Popolo in Genoa positioned him strategically within the city's administrative and commercial heart, facilitating contact with potential patrons. This central location would have provided visibility for his workshop and ease of access for clients from both the civic government and the merchant community. The 1339 document recording his acceptance of Simonino Smeraldo da Rapallo as an apprentice was notarized in his workshop, indicating it served as both production facility and place of business. The fact that his apprentice came from Rapallo, another Ligurian coastal town, suggests Bartolomeo's reputation extended beyond Genoa itself to the surrounding region. The economic arrangement underlying such apprenticeships typically involved payment by the apprentice's family, representing another stream of income for the master painter. The artist's clientele likely included both ecclesiastical institutions and private individuals, reflecting the dual market for religious imagery in the fourteenth century. Confraternities, particularly those associated with the disciplinanti movement, would have constituted important patrons, as evidenced by the presence of disciplinanti figures in the predella of the Palermo Madonna. These lay religious organizations commissioned devotional images for their meeting halls and participated in public religious processions, creating sustained demand for paintings. The presence of symbols of the Passion in the predella of Bartolomeo's Madonna suggests the patron's specific devotional interests and possible connections to Passion-focused confraternities. Wealthy Genoese families with commercial interests throughout the Mediterranean may have commissioned portable devotional panels for private chapels or family oratories.[^1_6][^1_3]

### Painting Style and Technical Characteristics

Bartolomeo da Camogli's painting style represents a sophisticated synthesis of diverse artistic currents circulating in the Mediterranean basin during the second quarter of the fourteenth century. The Madonna dell'Umiltà of 1346 demonstrates his absorption of Sienese artistic principles, particularly those associated with Simone Martini's mature work. The painting's elegant linear qualities, refined color harmonies, and graceful figural proportions all reflect the courtly sophistication characteristic of Sienese painting. The elaborate gold background, executed with typical Sienese attention to decorative patterning and texture, creates a luminous spatial environment that elevates the sacred figures above mundane reality. Bartolomeo's technique demonstrates mastery of tempera painting on wooden panels, the dominant medium for portable religious images in fourteenth-century Italy. His application of pigment reveals careful attention to modeling and volume, creating figures that possess three-dimensional presence while maintaining the essential flatness appropriate to sacred imagery. The Madonna's drapery displays complex arrangements of folds that demonstrate the artist's understanding of how fabric responds to the body beneath, though these remain stylized according to contemporary conventions rather than naturalistically observed. The color palette employed in the Palermo panel emphasizes rich, saturated hues—deep blues achieved with costly ultramarine, vermillion reds, and brilliant gold—indicating access to expensive pigments and presumably reflecting the patron's willingness to invest in materials. The predella section, depicting symbols of the Passion flanked by disciplinanti and other figures, demonstrates Bartolomeo's ability to organize complex narratives within limited pictorial space. These smaller figures maintain clarity and legibility while subordinating themselves to the dominant image of the Madonna and Child above. The artist's handling of hands and faces reveals particular attention to expressive potential, with the Madonna's downcast eyes and gentle expression conveying maternal tenderness and spiritual contemplation.[^1_8][^1_4][^1_2][^1_3]

Bartolomeo's painting demonstrates clear Avignonese influences, reflecting the dissemination of artistic ideas from the papal court where Simone Martini worked between 1335 and 1344. The Madonna dell'Umiltà iconography itself may derive from a prototype created by Simone in Avignon, possibly connected to the lost painting executed in 1346 for the chapel of Saint-Martial in the papal palace. The theological emphasis on Mary's humility corresponds to treatises written in Avignon by the Augustinian Agostino Trionfo, suggesting that Bartolomeo or his patrons were aware of current devotional trends promoted in papal circles. The decorative elements in Bartolomeo's painting—the patterned textiles, elaborate borders, and refined ornamental details—reveal the influence of international Gothic aesthetics being formulated at Avignon through the fusion of Italian and Northern European traditions. His approach to spatial construction demonstrates awareness of contemporary experiments in creating illusionistic depth, though he maintains essential adherence to hieratic principles that prioritize symbolic over naturalistic space. The gold ground, while traditional, receives sophisticated treatment through varied texturing and patterning that creates visual interest without undermining the transcendent quality of the sacred space. Bartolomeo's figural canon reflects the elongated proportions and graceful poses characteristic of international Gothic style, moving away from the more solidly grounded figures of early Trecento painting. The rhythmic interplay of curved and straight lines throughout the composition demonstrates sophisticated design sense, guiding the viewer's eye through the image while maintaining overall unity. His treatment of the Christ Child shows particular sensitivity, depicting the infant with both naturalistic observation of childhood and appropriate theological gravitas. The painting's surface quality reveals careful preparation of the wooden panel and meticulous application of paint layers, indicating thoroughly professional workshop practices.[^1_9][^1_2][^1_3]

### Artistic Influences and Formation

The formation of Bartolomeo da Camogli's artistic identity occurred at the intersection of multiple powerful currents in fourteenth-century Italian painting. His probable training in his father Opizzino's workshop would have provided foundational exposure to the hybrid artistic culture of early fourteenth-century Genoa, which combined lingering Byzantine traditions with newer influences from Tuscany. The identification of Opizzino with the Master of Santa Maria di Castello suggests that Bartolomeo's earliest artistic impressions included works influenced by the pre-Giottesque frescoes at Assisi, particularly those associated with Cimabue's workshop. This early exposure to monumental fresco decoration, even if mediated through his father's panel paintings, would have established expectations about figural weight, spatial organization, and narrative clarity. The presence in Genoa during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries of artists from diverse origins—including the Pistoiese Manfredino d'Alberto and various Lombard masters—created an eclectic artistic environment that shaped the young painter's development. Bartolomeo's mature style, however, shows decisive influence from Sienese painting, particularly that of Simone Martini, suggesting either direct contact with Sienese works or extensive exposure to their Genoese variants. Simone's presence in Naples from 1317 and his later activity in Avignon from 1335 to 1344 created networks of artistic diffusion that reached Genoa through multiple channels. The intense commercial relationships between Genoa, Siena, and the ports of Tuscany facilitated the movement of paintings, drawings, and perhaps artists themselves, creating opportunities for stylistic exchange. Bartolomeo may have encountered Simone's work through painted panels imported to Genoa or through the mediation of artists who had studied Sienese models. The specifically Avignonese inflection of Bartolomeo's Sienese influences suggests awareness of Simone's late production at the papal court, where the master developed increasingly refined and courtly adaptations of his earlier style. This knowledge could have reached Genoa through multiple means: traveling artists, pattern books, or actual paintings commissioned from Avignon.[^1_4][^1_5][^1_10][^1_2][^1_3][^1_9][^1_6]

The iconography of the Madonna dell'Umiltà adopted by Bartolomeo represents a relatively recent innovation in Marian imagery, with his 1346 panel constituting the earliest firmly dated example of this subject. This innovative choice suggests Bartolomeo participated in avant-garde developments in religious imagery rather than following established local conventions. Art historians have proposed that the Madonna dell'Umiltà type originated with Simone Martini, either during his Neapolitan period or more likely during his Avignon years. If the latter hypothesis is correct, Bartolomeo's adoption of this iconography would indicate remarkably current awareness of developments at the papal court. The theological emphasis on Mary's humility connected to contemporary spiritual movements, particularly those promoted by mendicant orders who emphasized poverty and humility as fundamental Christian virtues. Bartolomeo's interpretation of this theme demonstrates his ability to synthesize iconographic innovation with traditional pictorial forms, creating an image that felt simultaneously new and familiar. His placement of disciplinanti figures in the predella reveals awareness of contemporary devotional practices, particularly the flagellant confraternities active throughout Italy during the fourteenth century. This detail suggests either direct observation of such groups or response to specific patronal requirements. The inclusion of Passion symbols alongside the Madonna and Child creates typological connections between Christ's infancy and his sacrificial death, demonstrating sophisticated theological understanding. Bartolomeo's artistic formation also included technical training in the practical aspects of painting: panel preparation, pigment grinding, gold application, and varnishing. These craft skills, transmitted through workshop practice, were as essential to his identity as a painter as his ability to compose elegant figures and harmonious colors. The artist's demonstrated competence in organizing complex compositions and managing the relationship between main image and predella scenes indicates thorough professional formation.[^1_7][^1_2][^1_3]

### Travels and Geographical Scope

The question of Bartolomeo da Camogli's travels remains largely speculative due to the limited documentary evidence concerning his life and career. The presence of his signed and dated Madonna dell'Umiltà in Palermo raises the most obvious question about whether the artist traveled to Sicily to execute this commission. The painting's original location in the cloister of San Francesco, where Genoese merchants maintained a chapel, could suggest either that Bartolomeo traveled to Palermo or that the panel was painted in Genoa and shipped to Sicily. The latter scenario appears more probable given the established patterns of artistic commerce in the medieval Mediterranean, where paintings regularly traveled as cargo aboard merchant vessels. Genoa's extensive maritime network, which connected the Ligurian capital to ports throughout the Mediterranean, facilitated the movement of artworks as well as the goods that constituted the primary trade. The Genoese community in Palermo was substantial during the fourteenth century, creating sustained demand for religious and secular imagery that reflected their cultural origins while adapting to Sicilian contexts. If Bartolomeo did travel to Sicily, such a journey would have provided exposure to the complex artistic culture of the island, where Norman, Byzantine, Islamic, and Italian traditions created distinctive hybrid forms. However, no documentary evidence places Bartolomeo outside Genoa, and the painting's execution style shows no particular adaptation to Sicilian artistic conventions that might suggest direct experience of the island's visual culture. The artist's documented workshop location in Genoa near the Palazzo dell'Abate del Popolo suggests he maintained a stable physical presence in the city. The 1346 commission for an altarpiece in the Genoese church of San Siro, dated to the same year as the Palermo Madonna, makes extended absence from Genoa during this period unlikely. It seems probable that Bartolomeo operated primarily or exclusively from his Genoese workshop, producing works for local clients and for export to distant markets. This pattern of production—maintaining a fixed workshop while serving geographically dispersed clientele—was typical of medieval artistic practice, particularly in major commercial centers like Genoa.[^1_5][^1_2][^1_3][^1_6]

The question of whether Bartolomeo traveled to Tuscany or Avignon to study Sienese and Avignonese painting directly cannot be answered with certainty from available evidence. The strong Sienese and Avignonese influences in his work might result from direct exposure through travel, or equally from intensive study of imported paintings and drawings. Overland travel from Genoa to Siena or Florence was certainly feasible, following established routes through the Apennines that connected Liguria to Tuscany. Such a journey would have allowed Bartolomeo to view major fresco cycles and altarpieces in situ, providing formative experiences that drawings or small portable works could not replicate. The distance from Genoa to Avignon, while greater, was also manageable for a determined traveler, and the papal court's attraction for artists throughout the fourteenth century might have motivated such a journey. However, the expense and time required for such travel, combined with the need to maintain workshop production in Genoa, may have made extended journeys impractical for an artist who was not independently wealthy. Alternatively, Bartolomeo may have studied under a master who had direct experience of Sienese or Avignonese painting, providing mediated access to these traditions without requiring personal travel. The circulation of drawings, pattern books, and portable paintings created networks of artistic influence that did not depend on individual artists' mobility. Genoa's position as a major port ensured regular traffic of merchants, clerics, and others who might carry artistic materials or information about current developments elsewhere. The presence in Genoa of artists from other regions—documented for various Lombard and Tuscan masters—created opportunities for exchange without travel. Bartolomeo's apparent lack of extended absence from Genoa during his documented career suggests his artistic formation and development occurred primarily within the Ligurian capital's boundaries.[^1_3][^1_5][^1_9]

### Death and Historical Context

Bartolomeo da Camogli died before October 1348, when documentary evidence records that another painter, Giovanni Re da Rapallo, succeeded him in the rental of a house located on the piazza of the Commune of Genoa. The timing of his death strongly suggests he fell victim to the Black Death, which struck Genoa with devastating force during 1348. The plague pandemic, arriving in Europe from the East via Mediterranean trade routes, reached Italian ports in late 1347 and spread with horrific speed throughout 1348. Genoa, as a major port city with extensive commercial connections throughout the Mediterranean, experienced the disease's arrival early and suffered massive mortality. The artistic community of Italy was particularly hard hit by the plague, with numerous prominent painters dying during 1348, including probably Ambrogio and Pietro Lorenzetti in Siena and Bernardo Daddi in Florence. The Black Death's impact on artistic production was both immediate and long-lasting, as workshops lost masters and apprentices, commissions ceased during the crisis, and patronage patterns shifted in response to the trauma. The sudden deaths of established masters like Bartolomeo created opportunities for younger artists but also represented catastrophic loss of accumulated knowledge and skill. Art historians have debated whether the plague's psychological impact influenced stylistic developments in mid-fourteenth-century painting, with some arguing that post-plague art became more austere and hieratic in response to collective trauma. Bartolomeo's death at approximately age forty-eight, assuming a birth date around 1300, cut short what appeared to be a successful career. His most significant surviving work, the Madonna dell'Umiltà, was completed only two years before his presumed death, suggesting he remained artistically active until the plague's arrival. The loss of the altarpiece commissioned for San Siro prevents assessment of whether his style evolved during these final years. The circumstances of his death—presumably rapid and traumatic like most plague victims—meant no opportunity for orderly disposition of his workshop or training of successors to carry on his specific artistic approach.[^1_11][^1_12][^1_13][^1_2][^1_3]

The historical significance of Bartolomeo's death extends beyond individual tragedy to exemplify the broader crisis confronting Italian artistic culture in 1348. The plague killed not only masters but apprentices and journeymen, disrupting the intergenerational transmission of craft knowledge that sustained artistic traditions. Workshops like Bartolomeo's, which depended on stable master-apprentice relationships to maintain production and quality, faced existential challenges when disease killed members at all levels. The economic disruption following the plague—reduced population, disrupted trade, aristocratic and merchant families devastated or extinct—further undermined the patronage networks that sustained painters. Bartolomeo's specific technical knowledge and stylistic approaches, unless transmitted to surviving students, died with him, contributing to the fragmentation of artistic traditions that characterizes mid-fourteenth-century Italian painting. The wider Pellerano family workshop tradition apparently did not survive, as no later painters bearing this name are documented in Genoa. The artist's death before age fifty meant the loss of potentially two or three more decades of production and development. Had Bartolomeo survived the plague, he might have played a significant role in training the next generation of Ligurian painters and in adapting his synthesis of Sienese and Avignonese styles to evolving conditions. Instead, his legacy rests primarily on a single surviving signed work, the Madonna dell'Umiltà now in Palermo. This painting's preservation owes much to its location in Sicily, which may have protected it from subsequent Genoese upheavals. The disappearance or destruction of other works by Bartolomeo—including the documented San Siro altarpiece—exemplifies the fragmentary survival of fourteenth-century painting. The cause of this loss was not only the plague itself but subsequent centuries of changing taste, institutional disruption, and physical deterioration.[^1_12][^1_2][^1_11][^1_3]

### Principal Works and Their Content

The Madonna dell'Umiltà, signed and dated 1346, now in the Galleria Regionale della Sicilia at Palazzo Abatellis in Palermo, constitutes Bartolomeo da Camogli's only securely attributed and preserved work. This tempera painting on wooden panel measures approximately modest dimensions appropriate for a devotional image intended for a chapel or oratory setting. The work's signature reads "Nostra Domina de Humilitate / MCCCXXXXVI hoc / opus pinsit mag / ister Bartolomeus de / Camulio pintor," providing unequivocal documentation of authorship and execution date. The painting's provenance traces to the cloister of San Francesco in Palermo, where the Genoese merchant community maintained a chapel, though whether this represents its original destination remains uncertain. The iconographic program presents the Virgin Mary seated on the ground or a low cushion, holding the Christ Child on her lap, in the distinctive pose that defines the Madonna dell'Umiltà type. This composition emphasizes Mary's humility by placing her at ground level rather than enthroned, though the rich materials and elaborate gold background simultaneously assert her regal status. The Virgin wears a blue mantle over a red dress, traditional Marian colors executed with expensive ultramarine and vermillion pigments that demonstrate the commission's significance. Her face, rendered with delicate modeling and a gentle downward gaze, expresses maternal tenderness and spiritual contemplation. The Christ Child, depicted nude or minimally clothed, rests on his mother's knees in a pose that prefigures his Passion and death. The painting's gold background features elaborate tooled patterns that create luminous decorative effects while establishing a transcendent spatial environment. The predella, or lower register of the panel, contains an iconographically complex program depicting symbols of the Passion—instruments of Christ's torture and death—flanked by two groups of disciplinanti (flagellant confraternity members) and other worshippers. This unusual combination of Marian devotion with Passion imagery reflects the theological understanding of Mary's role in salvation history and may respond to specific devotional preferences of the patron or the Franciscan context. The disciplinanti figures wear the characteristic hooded robes of flagellant confraternities and appear in poses of prayer or self-mortification, connecting the painting to contemporary devotional movements that emphasized physical penance. The iconographic importance of this painting extends beyond its aesthetic qualities, as it constitutes the earliest firmly dated example of the Madonna dell'Umiltà type, establishing a chronological reference point for art historical study of this subject's development.[^1_14][^1_2][^1_8][^1_7][^1_3]

The lost altarpiece commissioned for the church of San Siro in Genoa on March 30, 1346, represents a tantalizing gap in understanding Bartolomeo's oeuvre. Documentary evidence records only the commission's existence and date, providing no information about the work's iconographic program, dimensions, or formal characteristics. San Siro, one of Genoa's most important churches, would have demanded an altarpiece of substantial quality and probably significant size, suggesting this was a major commission that demonstrated Bartolomeo's standing in the local artistic community. The church's dedication to San Siro (Saint Syrus), an early Christian bishop of Genoa, suggests the altarpiece may have featured this local saint, though many Genoese altarpieces included multiple saints and complex narrative scenes. The commission's date, March 1346, places it in close temporal proximity to the signed Palermo Madonna, raising questions about workshop organization and whether Bartolomeo employed assistants to manage multiple simultaneous projects. The altarpiece's disappearance may result from any number of historical vicissitudes: liturgical reforms that led to replacement of older works, physical deterioration, destruction during Genoa's frequent political upheavals, or simple loss of attribution over centuries. Art historians have attempted to identify surviving Genoese paintings that might represent Bartolomeo's work, but without secure documentation or stylistic comparisons to multiple authenticated pieces, such attributions remain speculative. The 1346 frontispiece of the Matricola dei Caravana, preserved in Genoa's Archivio di Stato, has been proposed as showing connections to Bartolomeo's style, suggesting possible authorship or workshop production. This illuminated manuscript page demonstrates sophisticated execution and stylistic affinities with Sienese-influenced painting, making the attribution plausible though unproven. A polyptych depicting the Madonna and Child with scenes from the Life of Mary and the Passion, formerly in Savona and now in Albi Cathedral, has also been discussed in relation to Bartolomeo's artistic milieu, though direct attribution remains contested. These fragmentary connections between surviving works and documentary evidence about Bartolomeo illustrate the challenges of reconstructing fourteenth-century artistic production from incomplete records.[^1_3]

**Ideas for you to explore**: Given your specialization in medieval illuminated manuscripts and fourteenth-century Italian art, Bartolomeo da Camogli's Madonna dell'Umiltà in Palazzo Abatellis would reward close examination, particularly for its relationship to Sienese manuscript illumination techniques. The predella's disciplinanti imagery connects to confraternity visual culture you've researched, and the painting's signed status makes it invaluable for understanding Genoese-Sicilian artistic networks. The documented 1346 Matricola dei Caravana manuscript in Genoa's Archivio di Stato, potentially connected to Bartolomeo's workshop, would offer manuscript research opportunities combining your interests in both panel and manuscript painting.[^1_2][^1_14][^1_3]
